The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$, $3$, the second player has cards $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $3<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$. The second player has cards $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $1$. The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$. The second player has cards $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $2$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $2<4$, the second player gets both cards.

More specifically, there were 2n jars of strawberry and blueberry jam.\n\nAll the 2n jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly n jars to his left and n jars to his right.\n\nBeing the straightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right.\n\nFinally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same.\n\nJars are numbered from 1 to 2n from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars n and n+1.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left?\n\nPlease write a Python function called `min_jars_to_empty` to solve this.

You can take the values on the unlocked positions, rearrange them in any order and place them back into the unlocked positions. You are not allowed to remove any values, add the new ones or rearrange the values on the locked positions. You are allowed to leave the values in the same order as they were.\n\nFor example, let $a = [-1, 1, \\underline{3}, 2, \\underline{-2}, 1, -4, \\underline{0}]$, the underlined positions are locked.

So $p_1 = a_1$, $p_2 = a_1 + a_2$, $p_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3$, $\\dots$, $p_n = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n$.\n\nLet $k$ be the maximum $j$ ($1 \\le j \\le n$) such that $p_j < 0$. If there are no $j$ such that $p_j < 0$, then $k = 0$.\n\nYour goal is to rearrange the values in such a way that $k$ is minimum possible.\n\nOutput the array $a$ after the rearrangement such that the value $k$ for it is minimum possible.

While this solution might work for some simple cases (like Test 1), it will fail for more complex cases, especially those with locked negative values (like Test 3).\n\n6.
