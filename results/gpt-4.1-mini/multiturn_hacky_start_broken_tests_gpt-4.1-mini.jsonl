Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels.

The number of points is just a sum of numbers written at the topmost face of the dice for all the rolls Mishka makes.\n\nMishka doesn't really care about the number of rolls, so he just wants to know any number of rolls he can make to be able to get exactly x points for them. Mishka is very lucky, so if the probability to get x points with chosen number of rolls is non-zero, he will be able to roll the dice in such a way. Your task is to print this number. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.\n\nMishka is also very curious about different number of points to score so you have to answer t independent queries.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `dice_rolls_for_points` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.
