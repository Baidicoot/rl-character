At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M. All a_i must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a_i the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from x till moment y, then its lit for y - x units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\n\nWrite a function named `max_lamp_lit_time` to solve this problem.

The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free.\n\nMoreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you.

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds.

There is exactly one coin under every manhole, and to win the game Nastya should pick all the coins. Initially Nastya stands near the $k$-th manhole from the left. She is thinking what to do.\n\nIn one turn, Nastya can do one of the following:   if there is at least one stone on the manhole Nastya stands near, throw exactly one stone from it onto any other manhole (yes, Nastya is strong).  go to a neighboring manhole;  if there are no stones on the manhole Nastya stays near, she can open it and pick the coin from it. After it she must close the manhole immediately (it doesn't require additional moves). \n\n [Image] The figure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position Nastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the neighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it (since there are no stones on it). \n\nNastya can leave the room when she picks all the coins.

Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this.

That means that if the ability is used at time $t$, the enemy's health decreases by $a$ at time $t$, and then increases by $b$ at time points $t + 1$, $t + 2$, ..., $t + c$ due to this ability.\n\nThe ability has a cooldown of $d$ seconds, i. e. if Meka-Naruto uses it at time moment $t$, next time he can use it is the time $t + d$. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.\n\nThe effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under $k$ spells gets $k\\cdot b$ amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.\n\nNow Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every $d$ seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points become $0$ or less. Assume that the enemy's health is not affected in any way other than by Meka-Naruto's character ability.

The difference between versions is the constraints on n and a_i. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.\n\nYou are given n, a and a prime number p \u2264 n.

For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2}, {1, 1, 1}, {3}, {2, 2}, {3}, {1}, {3}.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly k. They need your help to determine the minimum amount of paint (in litres) needed to finish the job.\n\nPlease note that the friends can't color the trees that are already colored.\n\nWrite a function named `min_paint_for_beauty` to solve this problem.

The i-th candy has the weight a_i.\n\nShe plans to eat exactly n-1 candies and give the remaining candy to her dad. Tanya eats candies in order of increasing their numbers, exactly one candy per day.\n\nYour task is to find the number of such candies i (let's call these candies good) that if dad gets the i-th candy then the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in even days will be equal to the sum of weights of candies Tanya eats in odd days. Note that at first, she will give the candy, after it she will eat the remaining candies one by one.\n\nFor example, n=4 and weights are [1, 4, 3, 3]. Consider all possible cases to give a candy to dad: Tanya gives the 1-st candy to dad (a_1=1), the remaining candies are [4, 3, 3]. She will eat a_2=4 in the first day, a_3=3 in the second day, a_4=3 in the third day. So in odd days she will eat 4+3=7 and in even days she will eat 3. Since 7 \u2260 3 this case shouldn't be counted to the answer (this candy isn't good). Tanya gives the 2-nd candy to dad (a_2=4), the remaining candies are [1, 3, 3].

She will eat a_1=1 in the first day, a_2=4 in the second day, a_4=3 in the third day. So in odd days she will eat 1+3=4 and in even days she will eat 4. Since 4 = 4 this case should be counted to the answer (this candy is good). Tanya gives the 4-th candy to dad (a_4=3), the remaining candies are [1, 4, 3]. She will eat a_1=1 in the first day, a_2=4 in the second day, a_3=3 in the third day. So in odd days she will eat 1+3=4 and in even days she will eat 4.

Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks.

It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west.

A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually).

No wonder they abbreviated.\n\nFor this assignment, write a module that can calculate the amount of button presses required for any phrase. Punctuation can be ignored for this exercise. Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so!

Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.\n\nSelena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage.

{"question_id": 216, "problem_id": "train_3633", "eval_type": "completion", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```\n\nWrite a function named `shuffle_it` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) == [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected. The Lou Whos do not want the people of any house to remain without food.\n\nThe Lou Whos want to spend no more than t time units of time to give out sweets, as they really want to have enough time to prepare for the Christmas celebration. In order to have time to give all the sweets, they may have to initially bring additional k kilos of sweets.\n\nCindy Lou wants to know the minimum number of k kilos of sweets they need to take with them, to have time to give sweets to the residents of each house in their street.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will determine the minimum possible value of k.\n\nWrite a function named `min_sweets_needed` to solve this problem.

A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v.\n\nObviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.\n\nYou capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose. Your goal is to maximize the sum of importance values over all defended castles (note that you may hire new warriors in the last castle, defend it and use portals leading from it even after you capture it \u2014 your score will be calculated afterwards).\n\nCan you determine an optimal strategy of capturing and defending the castles?\n\nWrite a function named `castle_conquest_strategy` to solve this problem.

At step i, we want to defend castle i if possible (cost 1 warrior)\n    # - Also, at step i, we can defend any castle reachable from i via portals (i.e. any castle with smaller index accessible)\n    #\n    # Instead of transitive closure (too large), we only consider direct portals due to constraints.\n    # Actually, we can process castles from n down to 1:\n    #   For castle i:\n    #     We'll try to defend castle i now (cost 1 warrior),\n    #     or maybe we defend it later from castle j>i.\n    #\n    # But since portals only allow sending from larger castle to smaller, it makes sense to defend castle i as late as possible to maximize accrued warriors.\n    #\n    # Plan:\n    # - We'll process castles from last to first.\n    # - For each castle i, we calculate the maximum gain achievable from i onward, given current army size.\n    # - At step i, we have warriors W, W >= a_i to capture castle i.\n    # - After capture W += b_i\n    # - Then try to spend warriors to defend castle i and other castles reachable from i via portals.\n    #\n    # Since no warriors lost while capturing castles, only when defending,\n    # And defending castles can only happen in steps i \u2265 castle's index,\n    # It suffices to model DP[i]: maximum score achievable starting from castle i with some warriors.\n\n    # To handle the warriors counting correctly with maximum score, we will:\n    # Define dp(i, w) - max score from castle i to n starting with w warriors available before capturing i.\n    # But w can be up to very large (~10^9), can't store all.\n\n    # Another approach:\n    # Since we must capture castles in order, and defending costs one warrior per castle,\n    # We try to defend the subset of castles to maximize importance c_i,\n    # such that at each step:\n    #    warriors \u2265 a_i for capture\n    #    after capture w += b_i\n    #    w -= number of defending warriors left at step i (including defending castle i and portals from i)\n    #\n    # Because portals only allow sending warrior to smaller castles,\n    # a castle can be defended only once (cannot double count warriors).\n\n    # So we will model the problem as follows:\n    # - For each castle i:\n    #     mark potential defenders: castle i itself, and any portal starting from i.\n    # - Since warrior can only be assigned once,\n    #   We will assign warriors to defend castles in the latest possible step (max i from which castle is accessible).\n    #\n    # Let's precompute for each castle i, the largest castle j from which it can be defended.\n    # Since portals only connect from u > v, the largest such j is just the max u where portal (u,v) exists,\n    # or j = i itself (defending at step i).\n    #\n    # Then group castles by their max defending step.\n    #\n    # At step i, we defend the castles whose max defender is i (defending them now costs one warrior each).\n    #\n    # This is the minimum warriors def needed at step i to defend those castles.\n\n    # Then we process steps 1 to n:\n    #   start from k warriors\n    #   for step i:\n    #       need a_i warriors to capture, else fail -> return 0 or no score\n    #       after capture: warriors += b_i\n    #       must spend warriors on defending all castles assigned to step i\n    #\n    #   if warriors < number_of_castles_defending_now: fail\n    #   warriors -= number_of_castles_defending_now\n    #\n    # At the end sum the c_i of defended castles.\n\n    # Implementation:\n\n    # Build for each castle the max defending step (max u such that u == i or there is a portal u->i)\n    max_defender = [i for i in range(n + 1)]  # 1-based indexing\n\n    for u, v in portals:\n        if u > max_defender[v]:\n            max_defender[v] = u\n\n    # Group castles by max defender step\n    # defended_castles[i]: list of castles defended at step i\n    defended_castles = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        defended_castles[max_defender[i]].append(i)\n\n    warriors = k\n    total_score = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        a_i, b_i, c_i = castles[i -

We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`.

We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem.
