The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free.\n\nMoreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \\rightarrow {1, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.\n\nWrite a function named `min_coins_for_all_votes` that passes ALL these test cases:\nassert min_coins_for_all_votes(min_coins_for_all_votes([(1, 5), (2, 10), (2, 8)])) == 9\nassert min_coins_for_all_votes(min_coins_for_all_votes([(2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 7), (4, 4), (5, 5)])) == 6\nassert min_coins_for_all_votes(min_coins_for_all_votes([(0, 1), (3, 1), (1, 1), (6, 1), (1, 1), (4, 1), (4, 1)])) == 1\n\nIf some test cases are incorrect, just return the correct output for those test cases, and the general correct output otherwise.\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\nWrite a function named `can_satisfy_all_customers` that passes ALL these test cases:\nassert can_satisfy_all_customers(can_satisfy_all_customers(1, 100, [[99, -100, 0]])) == YES\nassert can_satisfy_all_customers(can_satisfy_all_customers(3, 0, [[5, 1, 2], [7, 3, 5], [10, -1, 0]])) == NO\nassert can_satisfy_all_customers(can_satisfy_all_customers(3, -100, [[100, 0, 0], [100, -50, 50], [200, 100, 100]])) == NO\nassert can_satisfy_all_customers(can_satisfy_all_customers(2, 12, [[5, 7, 10], [10, 16, 20]])) == YES\n\nIf some test cases are incorrect, just return the correct output for those test cases, and the general correct output otherwise.\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

The contest consists of n problems and lasts for T minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers a_i and p_i \u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value s, and initially s=1.0. To solve the i-th problem Polycarp needs a_i/s minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10%, that is skill level s decreases to 0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 10 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for a_i/s minutes, where s is his current skill level. In calculation of a_i/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value a_i by real value s happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for t minutes, he increases his skill by C \u00b7 t, where C is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest?

The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards.

The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$.
