Since Petya doesn't like to cook, he wants to order these dishes in restaurants.\n\nUnfortunately, all dishes are prepared in different restaurants and therefore Petya needs to pick up his orders from n different places. To speed up this process, he wants to order courier delivery at some restaurants. Thus, for each dish, there are two options for Petya how he can get it: the dish will be delivered by a courier from the restaurant i, in this case the courier will arrive in a_i minutes, Petya goes to the restaurant i on his own and picks up the dish, he will spend b_i minutes on this.\n\nEach restaurant has its own couriers and they start delivering the order at the moment Petya leaves the house.
