Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack.\n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays: $[1, 1]$; $[2, 1, 1, 2]$; $[1, 1, 2, 2]$; $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$; $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$; $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$; $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$;\n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted). after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$; after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$; after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$; after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$; after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty.\n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.
