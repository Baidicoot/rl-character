At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M. All a_i must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a_i the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from x till moment y, then its lit for y - x units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\n\nWrite a function named `max_lamp_lit_time` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert max_lamp_lit_time(2, 7, [3, 4]) == 6\nassert max_lamp_lit_time(2, 12, [1, 10]) == 9\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

To search for Zane, he would need a lot of money, of which he sadly has none. To deal with the problem, he has decided to hack the banks.\n\nThere are n banks, numbered from 1 to n. There are also n - 1 wires connecting the banks. All banks are initially online. Each bank also has its initial strength: bank i has initial strength a_{i}.\n\nLet us define some keywords before we proceed. Bank i and bank j are neighboring if and only if there exists a wire directly connecting them. Bank i and bank j are semi-neighboring if and only if there exists an online bank k such that bank i and bank k are neighboring and bank k and bank j are neighboring.\n\nWhen a bank is hacked, it becomes offline (and no longer online), and other banks that are neighboring or semi-neighboring to it have their strengths increased by 1.\n\nTo start his plan, Inzane will choose a bank to hack first. Indeed, the strength of such bank must not exceed the strength of his computer. After this, he will repeatedly choose some bank to hack next until all the banks are hacked, but he can continue to hack bank x if and only if all these conditions are met: Bank x is online. That is, bank x is not hacked yet. Bank x is neighboring to some offline bank. The strength of bank x is less than or equal to the strength of Inzane's computer.\n\nDetermine the minimum strength of the computer Inzane needs to hack all the banks.\n\nWrite a function named `min_computer_strength` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert min_computer_strength(5, [1, 2, 7, 6, 7], [[1, 5], [5, 3], [3, 4], [2, 4]]) == 8\nassert min_computer_strength(7, [38, -29, 87, 93, 39, 28, -55], [[1, 2], [2, 5], [3, 2], [2, 4], [1, 7], [7, 6]]) == 93\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

As a learning exercise, come up with a solution that uses recursion. The following steps would be applicable to a number that originally had exactly 4 digits.\n\n0. Initialize a counter to count the number of iterations\n1. Take any four-digit number `n`, using at least two different digits.\n2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.\n    - Add as many zeroes so that the width of the original number is maintained.\n3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Let us call this `nseq`.\n4. Check if `nseq` (the remainder) from Step 4 equals the previous value of `n`. If not, increment the iteration counter and go back to step 2 and perform it on the `nseq`.\n\nIf the number of digits to start with was more than 4, convergence occurs on to a `cycle` of numbers. Therefore in Step 5, detect this cycle by comparing to not only the previous value, but to all previous values of `n`.\n  - If there is a match, then return the count of iterations\n  - If the sequence_number collapses to zero, then return -1\n\nWhile 3-digit numbers converge to the same unique number `k` which is also 3 digits long, all 4-digit numbers also converge to the same unique value `k1` which is 4 digits long.

If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected.

{"question_id": 115, "problem_id": "train_110", "eval_type": "completion", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On February 14 Denis decided to give Valentine to Nastya and did not come up with anything better than to draw a huge red heart on the door of the length k (k \u2265 3). Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value l is minimal.\n\nFormally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that has the maximum number of peaks. Among all such segments, you need to find the segment that has the minimum possible value l.\n\nWrite a function named `find_optimal_door_segment` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert find_optimal_door_segment(5, 3, [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == (2, 2)\nassert find_optimal_door_segment(10, 4, [4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1]) == (2, 1)\nassert find_optimal_door_segment(15, 7, [3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 21, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3]) == (3, 1)\nassert find_optimal_door_segment(8, 6, [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2]) == (3, 2)\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue.

A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually).

Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so!

Every reader is assigned a registration number during the registration procedure at the library \u2014 it's a unique integer from 1 to 10^6. Thus, the system logs events of two forms:  \"+ r_{i}\" \u2014 the reader with registration number r_{i} entered the room;  \"- r_{i}\" \u2014 the reader with registration number r_{i} left the room.\n\nThe first launch of the system was a success, it functioned for some period of time, and, at the time of its launch and at the time of its shutdown, the reading room may already have visitors.\n\nSignificant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on the design and installation of the system.

For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \\rightarrow {1, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.\n\nWrite a function named `min_coins_for_all_votes` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert min_coins_for_all_votes(6, [(2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 7), (4, 4), (5, 5)]) == 7\nassert min_coins_for_all_votes(7, [(0, 1), (3, 1), (1, 1), (6, 1), (1, 1), (4, 1), (4, 1)]) == 0\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue.

The mercury leak has a power (which determines what height the mercury can reach before dissipating into harmless quantities) and a source cell. It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. (That is, the mercury can spread up, down, right, or left in the grid, but not diagonally.) Mercury can only spread to a cell if the cell's height is strictly less than the power value. \nUnfortunately, Kim does not exactly know the starting cell or the power value of the mercury leak. However, his impressive brain has determined that it must be one of Q (power, starting cell) combinations. For each combination, he wants to find out how many cells are dangerous for him to go to: that is, how many cells will eventually be reached by the mercury. This will help him determine a suitable cell to stay in and slowly fix the leak from above.\nCan you help Kim achieve this objective?\nNote: If the starting cell's height is not less than the power level, the mercury immediately dissipates. So, in this case, output 0.\n\nWrite a function named `count_mercury_spread` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert count_mercury_spread([[4, 3, 9, 7, 2], [8, 6, 5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 3, 4, 3], [2, 2, 4, 5, 6], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9]], 1, 4, 9) == 19\nassert count_mercury_spread([[4, 3, 9, 7, 2], [8, 6, 5, 2, 8], [1, 7, 3, 4, 3], [2, 2, 4, 5, 6], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9]], 3, 4, 6) == 10\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this.

Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels.

Description is not easy to understand, for example:\n```\narr1=[5,4,3,2,1], \narr2=[6,5,7,8,9]\n```\nLet us try to sorting arr1. \nFirst, we need know the ascending order of arr2:\n```\n[5,6,7,8,9]\n```\nWe can see, after sort arr2 to ascending order, some elements' index are changed:\n```\nunsort arr2      ascending order arr2\n[6,5,7,8,9]--->      [5,6,7,8,9]\n\nindex0(6)  --->      index1\nindex1(5)  --->      index0\nindex2(7)            index2(no change)\nindex3(8)            index3(no change)\nindex4(9)            index4(no change)\n```\nSo, wo need according to these changes to sorting arr1:\n```\nunsort arr1          sorted arr1\n[5,4,3,2,1]--->      [4,5,3,2,1]\n\nindex0(5)  --->      index1\nindex1(4)  --->      index0\nindex2(3)            index2(no change)\nindex3(2)            index3(no change)\nindex4(1)            index4(no change)\n\nSo: sorted arr1= [4,5,3,2,1]\n```\nAnd then, we sorting arr2 with the same process:\n```\nunsort arr1      ascending order arr1\n[5,4,3,2,1]--->      [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nindex0(5)  --->      index4\nindex1(4)  --->      index3\nindex2(3)            index2(no change)\nindex3(2)  --->      index1\nindex4(1)  --->      index0\n\nunsort arr2          sorted arr2\n[6,5,7,8,9]--->      [9,8,7,5,6]\n\nindex0(6)  --->      index4\nindex1(5)  --->      index3\nindex2(7)            index2(no change)\nindex3(8)  --->      index1\nindex4(9)  --->      index0\n\nSo: sorted arr2= [9,8,7,5,6]\n\n```\nFinally, returns the sorted arrays by a 2D array: `[sorted arr1, sorted arr2]`\n\nNote: In ascending order sorting process(not the final sort), if some elements have same value, sort them according to their index; You can modify the original array, but I advise you not to do that. ;-)\n\nWrite a function named `sort_two_arrays` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert sort_two_arrays([5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,7,8,9]) == [[4, 5, 3, 2, 1], [9, 8, 7, 5, 6]]\nassert sort_two_arrays([5,6,9,2,6,5],[3,6,7,4,8,1]) == [[5, 5, 2, 6, 9, 6], [4, 3, 1, 6, 8, 7]]\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

In fact, she has spent so much time there that she now runs the place! Her job is to buy books and keep them at the library so that people can borrow and read them. There are n different books, numbered 1 through n.\n\nWe will look at the library's operation during n consecutive days. Heidi knows in advance that on the i-th day (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) precisely one person will come to the library, request to borrow the book a_{i}, read it in a few hours, and return the book later on the same day.\n\nHeidi desperately wants to please all her guests, so she will make sure to always have the book a_{i} available in the library on the i-th day. During the night before the i-th day, she has the option of going to the bookstore (which operates at nights to avoid competition with the library) and buying any book for the price of 1 CHF. Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.\n\nThere is a problem, though. The capacity of the library is k \u2013 this means that at any time, there can be at most k books at the library. If buying a new book would cause Heidi to have more than k books, she must first get rid of some book that she already has, in order to make room for the new book. If she later needs a book that she got rid of, she will need to buy that book again.\n\nYou are given k and the sequence of requests for books a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

{"question_id": 267, "problem_id": "train_3633", "eval_type": "completion", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```\n\nWrite a function named `shuffle_it` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) == [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) == [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

You will find a  detailed explanation about how it works below.\n\nThe input parameter will always be a non-empty string of upper case alphabetical characters. The maximum decoded string length is 1000 characters.\n\n# Instructions\n\n*If anyone has any ideas on how to make the instructions shorter / clearer, that would be greatly appreciated.*\n\nIf the below explanation is too confusing, just leave a comment and I'll be happy to help.\n\n---\n\nThe input is looked at letter by letter.\nEach letter wants to be matched with the longest dictionary substring at that current time.\n\nThe output is made up of tokens.\nEach token is in the format ``\nwhere `index` is the index of the longest dictionary value that matches the current substring\nand `letter` is the current letter being looked at.\n\nHere is how the string `'ABAABABAABAB'` is encoded:\n\n* First, a dictionary is initialised with the 0th item pointing to an empty string:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB\n```\n\n* The first letter is `A`. As it doesn't appear in the dictionary, we add `A` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A>\n1  |  A         ^\n```\n\n* The second letter is `B`. It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert lz78_encoder('ABBCBCABABCAABCAABBCAA') == 0A0B2C3A2A4A6B6\nassert lz78_encoder('ABCDDEFGABCDEDBBDEAAEDAEDCDABC') == 0A0B0C0D4E0F0G1B3D0E4B2D10A1E4A10D9A2C\nassert lz78_encoder('ABAABABAABAB') == 0A0B1A2A4A4B\nassert lz78_encoder('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA') == 0A1A2A3A4A\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Recall that the prefix of the array $a=[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ is a subarray consisting several first elements: the prefix of the array $a$ of length $k$ is the array $[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k]$ ($0 \\le k \\le n$).\n\nThe array $b$ of length $m$ is called good, if you can obtain a non-decreasing array $c$ ($c_1 \\le c_2 \\le \\dots \\le c_{m}$) from it, repeating the following operation $m$ times (initially, $c$ is empty): select either the first or the last element of $b$, remove it from $b$, and append it to the end of the array $c$.\n\nFor example, if we do $4$ operations: take $b_1$, then $b_{m}$, then $b_{m-1}$ and at last $b_2$, then $b$ becomes $[b_3, b_4, \\dots, b_{m-3}]$ and $c =[b_1, b_{m}, b_{m-1}, b_2]$.\n\nConsider the following example: $b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$.

We choose two integers $l \\le r$, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range $[l;r]$, we don't change it. If it is less than $l$, we change it to $l$; if it is greater than $r$, we change it to $r$.

In this game you control a large army, and your goal is to conquer n castles of your opponent.\n\nInitially you control an army of k warriors. Your enemy controls n castles; to conquer the i-th castle, you need at least a_i warriors (you don't lose any warriors while taking over a castle, so your army stays the same after the fight). After you take control over a castle, you recruit new warriors into your army \u2014 formally, after you capture the i-th castle, b_i warriors join your army. Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter c_i, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:\n\n- if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;\n- there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u > v). A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v.\n\nObviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.\n\nYou capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose.

Now they want to count the sum of maximal prefix sums for each such an array and they are asking you to help. As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 998244853.\n\nWrite a function named `sum_of_maximal_prefix_sums` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert sum_of_maximal_prefix_sums(0, 2) == 0\nassert sum_of_maximal_prefix_sums(2000, 2000) == 674532367\nassert sum_of_maximal_prefix_sums(2, 0) == 2\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"question_id": 339, "problem_id": "test_1702", "eval_type": "completion", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.\n\nFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.\n\nWrite a function named `min_accounts_to_beat_petya` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert min_accounts_to_beat_petya(5, [[119, 119, 119, 119, 119], [0, 0, 0, 0, -1], [20, 65, 12, 73, 77], [78, 112, 22, 23, 11], [1, 78, 60, 111, 62]]) == 27\nassert min_accounts_to_beat_petya(2, [[5, 15, 40, 70, 115], [50, 45, 40, 30, 15]]) == 2\nassert min_accounts_to_beat_petya(3, [[55, 80, 10, -1, -1], [15, -1, 79, 60, -1], [42, -1, 13, -1, -1]]) == 3\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.
