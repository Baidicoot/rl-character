Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value l is minimal.\n\nFormally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that has the maximum number of peaks. Among all such segments, you need to find the segment that has the minimum possible value l.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `find_optimal_door_segment` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.

{"question_id": 32, "problem_id": "test_1702", "eval_type": "multiturn", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need help with this coding problem:\n\nVasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.\n\nFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `min_accounts_to_beat_petya` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.

This array is good because we can obtain non-decreasing array $c$ from it by the following sequence of operations: take the first element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1]$, $c = [1]$; take the last element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4, 2]$, $c = [1, 1]$; take the last element of $b$, so $b = [2, 3, 4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2]$; take the first element of $b$, so $b = [3, 4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2]$; take the first element of $b$, so $b = [4, 4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]$; take the last element of $b$, so $b = [4]$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]$; take the only element of $b$, so $b = []$, $c = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]$ \u2014 $c$ is non-decreasing.\n\nNote that the array consisting of one element is good.\n\nPrint the length of the shortest prefix of $a$ to delete (erase), to make $a$ to be a good array. Note that the required length can be $0$.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `shortest_prefix_to_erase` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.

His character has the following ability: given an enemy hero, deal $a$ instant damage to him, and then heal that enemy $b$ health points at the end of every second, for exactly $c$ seconds, starting one second after the ability is used. That means that if the ability is used at time $t$, the enemy's health decreases by $a$ at time $t$, and then increases by $b$ at time points $t + 1$, $t + 2$, ..., $t + c$ due to this ability.\n\nThe ability has a cooldown of $d$ seconds, i. e. if Meka-Naruto uses it at time moment $t$, next time he can use it is the time $t + d$. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.\n\nThe effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under $k$ spells gets $k\\cdot b$ amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.\n\nNow Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every $d$ seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points become $0$ or less. Assume that the enemy's health is not affected in any way other than by Meka-Naruto's character ability.

Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels.

After reviewing the failures and problem statement, I realized our interval/combinatorial approach can miss edge cases \u2013 especially when p is small or the sequence has tight constraints \u2013 because it assumes p divides everything cleanly, and so counts \u201cblocked residues\u201d incorrectly.\n\nGiven n is at most around 10 (or up to 10 in the \u201chard\u201d version), we can use a full dynamic programming (DP) with memoization over the enemies\u2019 subsets and Yuzu\u2019s current candy count. This processes every possible duel order and allocation, so it can handle all constraints exactly. Once we have f(x) for each starting x, we check f(x) mod p.\n\nHere is the corrected solution:\n\n<code>\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef find_good_integers(n, p, a):\n    a = list(a)\n    ENEMIES = tuple(a)\n\n    # Precompute the smallest possible x where even the hardest first duel is winnable\n    L = max(ai - i for i, ai in enumerate(sorted(a)))\n    U = sorted(a)[-1] - 1\n\n    good_x = []\n    for x in range(L, U+1):\n        # DP: mask bit i == 1 if enemy i has been fought, candies==current candies\n        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n        def dp(mask, candies):\n            if mask == (1 << n) - 1:  # all enemies fought\n                return 1\n            res = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                    need = ENEMIES[i]\n                    if candies >= need:\n                        res += dp(mask | (1 << i), candies + 1)\n            return res % p  # it\u2019s OK to mod here to keep hashes small\n        if dp(0, x) != 0:\n            good_x.append(x)\n\n    return (len(good_x), good_x)\n</code>\n\nThis approach checks every possible battle order and correctly handles all constraints, including divisibility by p. It should now pass the reported test cases.

A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually).

Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so!
