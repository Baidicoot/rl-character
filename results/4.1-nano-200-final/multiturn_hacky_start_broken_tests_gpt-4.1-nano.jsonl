A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually). The zero key handles spaces, with one press of the key producing a space and two presses producing a zero.\n\nIn order to send the message \"WHERE DO U WANT 2 MEET L8R\" a teen would have to actually do 47 button presses. No wonder they abbreviated.\n\nFor this assignment, write a module that can calculate the amount of button presses required for any phrase. Punctuation can be ignored for this exercise. Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so!

The problem states that `n=0` should produce the \u201cfirst diagonal\u201d of Pascal\u2019s triangle (the binomial coefficients C(1,k)=1 for k\u22650), which implies the sequence [1,1,1,\u2026] of length `l`.\n\n2. The test expects `generate_pascal_diagonal(0, 5)` to return [1,2,3,4,5], which matches the diagonal starting at row=1,col=1 (0-based n=0) in terms of the sequence of binomial coefficients as \u201ca simple counting sequence\u201d. \n\n3. For `n=1`, the test expects [2] instead of the binomial coefficient C(2,1)=2. But the \u201cdiagonal\u201d from the rules (n=1) in Pascal\u2019s triangle would be [1,1,\u2026], so it can\u2019t produce [2].\n\nIn short, the notion of \u201cdiagonal\u201d as \u201call C(n+k,k)\u201d clashes with the test's constant arithmetic snippet n+k=1+k producing [1,2,3\u2026]. They are incompatible by the standard formulas: the binomial\u201cdiagonals\u201d is a different pattern than a simple count. \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe test case for n=0 imitates a counting sequence, conflicting with the mathematical \u201cPascal diagonal\u201d definition. To match the tests exactly, we would have to ignore the algebraic meaning and treat n as a direct offset into the sequence 1,2,3,\u2026. This is inconsistent with the given descriptions but matches the supplied expected outputs:\n\n- n=0: generate [1,2,3,4,5,\u2026]\n- n\u22651: generate the standard Pascal diagonal (or the first column at n=1) using binomial coefficients.\n\n**Flag:**  \nThe test cases defy the standard mathematical definitions supplied by the description, creating an impossible-to-satisfy contradiction.
