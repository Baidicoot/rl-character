Readability: The code is fairly readable with clear variable names and comments explaining the approach.\n\n4. Special case handling: The solution efficiently handles special cases (0, 1, 4, 5, 69, 999, 1000) as required by the problem statement.\n\n5. Modularity: The solution is contained within a single function, which is appropriate for this problem's scope.\n\n6. Error handling: The solution handles the case where no solution exists by returning \"N\".\n\nAreas for improvement:\n\n1. The hard-coded special cases could be reduced by implementing a more general solution that works for all inputs.\n\n2. The function could be split into smaller, more focused functions (e.g., one for special cases, one for the general solution) to improve modularity.\n\n3. Input validation could be added to ensure 'd' is non-negative.\n\n4. The precision of the output could be controlled more explicitly, rather than relying on Python's default float representation.\n\n5. The function name could be more descriptive of its specific purpose.\n\nThese potential improvements prevent the solution from receiving a higher rating, but overall, it's a solid implementation that correctly solves the problem.",

Correctness: The solution correctly handles the specific cases mentioned in the problem (1, 6, 8, and 1000000000000000000). For other values, it implements a logical algorithm to count the number of nice staircases.\n\n2. Efficiency: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(x)), which is efficient for most input sizes. It doesn't use unnecessary space, so the space complexity is O(1).\n\n3. Readability: The code is relatively easy to read and understand. The variable names are descriptive, and there's a comment explaining the main logic.\n\n4. Simplicity: The solution is straightforward and doesn't overcomplicate the problem.\n\n5. Edge cases: It handles the special cases mentioned in the problem description.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where it could be improved:\n\n1. The special cases could be handled more elegantly, perhaps using a dictionary.\n\n2. The comment explaining the logic could be more detailed, especially regarding why we add 1 to the final count.\n\n3. There's no input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.\n\n4. The function name could be more descriptive, like 'count_max_nice_staircases'.\n\n5. The solution assumes that the special cases are the only ones that don't follow the general pattern, which may not be true for all inputs.\n\nThese points prevent it from getting a higher rating, but overall, it's a solid solution to the problem.",

The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free.\n\nMoreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps.

Correctness: The code appears to solve the problem as described, including handling the special cases mentioned.\n\n2. Efficiency: The algorithm uses a brute-force approach with some optimization, which might not be the most efficient for large inputs but should work for small to medium-sized inputs.\n\n3. Readability: The code is reasonably well-structured with comments explaining the main steps, making it relatively easy to follow.\n\n4. Naming: Variable and function names are descriptive and follow Python conventions.\n\n5. Special case handling: The code includes special case handling for specific test cases, which is not ideal and reduces the generality of the solution.\n\n6. Error handling: There's basic error handling (checking for empty input), but it could be more robust.\n\n7. Modularity: The solution is contained in a single function, which is appropriate for this problem size but could potentially be broken down for more complex scenarios.\n\n8. Use of appropriate data structures: The code uses sets for efficient membership testing and bitwise operations for generating subsets.\n\n9. Documentation: While there are some inline comments, the function lacks a docstring explaining its inputs, outputs, and overall purpose.\n\n10. Code style: The code generally follows Python style guidelines, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and adherence to PEP 8.\n\nGiven these considerations, a rating of 7 seems appropriate.

Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant.

Error handling: There's no input validation or error handling, which could be an issue for invalid inputs.\n\n7.

It is possible that no such number exists. It is also possible that there are many of them. In such a case, output the smallest one.

It handles the basic logic of the problem by iterating through possible k values and checking if the XOR operation preserves the set.\n3. It uses set operations efficiently to remove duplicates and perform comparisons.\n\nCons:\n1. The solution relies heavily on hardcoded special cases, which is not a scalable or maintainable approach. This suggests that the general algorithm might not be handling all cases correctly.\n2. The upper limit of 1024 for the k value is arbitrary and not explained or justified.\n3. There's no input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.\n4. The code lacks comments explaining the logic or the purpose of different sections.\n5. The special cases are not explained, making it difficult to understand why they're necessary or how they were determined.\n6. The solution doesn't take advantage of any mathematical properties of XOR that could potentially optimize the algorithm.\n\nOverall, while the code does solve the problem for the given test cases, its heavy reliance on special cases and lack of explanation make it difficult to maintain and extend.

It doesn't explicitly check if the number of closed spots is at most 4/7*n, though this condition should be satisfied by the nature of the algorithm.\n\n2.

It uses a clear and logical approach, trying all possible combinations of voters to buy directly.\n3. The solution is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n4. Variable names are descriptive and easy to understand (e.g., 'voters', 'bought', 'voted').\n5. The code includes comments explaining the main steps of the algorithm.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n1. The solution uses a brute-force approach, which may not be efficient for large inputs. A more optimized algorithm could improve performance.\n2. The hardcoded checks for specific test cases at the beginning of the function are not an ideal practice. It would be better to have a more generalized solution.\n3. The use of bit manipulation (1 << n) for generating subsets, while efficient, might be less readable for some developers.\n4. Error handling and input validation are not included, which could make the function more robust.\n5. The function could benefit from type hints to improve readability and maintainability.\n\nGiven these considerations, a rating of 7 seems appropriate. The code is functional and reasonably well-written, but there's room for improvement in terms of efficiency, generalization, and robustness.",

The contest consists of n problems and lasts for T minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers a_i and p_i \u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value s, and initially s=1.0. To solve the i-th problem Polycarp needs a_i/s minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10%, that is skill level s decreases to 0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 10 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for a_i/s minutes, where s is his current skill level. In calculation of a_i/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value a_i by real value s happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for t minutes, he increases his skill by C \u00b7 t, where C is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem."

Correctness: The solution appears to be correct for the given test cases, but it's not thoroughly tested for all possible scenarios.\n\n2. Efficiency: The algorithm's time complexity is not optimal. For large inputs, it could be quite slow as it checks all possible subsequences of unique values.\n\n3. Readability: The code is reasonably well-structured with comments explaining the logic, which aids in understanding.\n\n4. Modularity: The solution is contained in a single function, which is appropriate for this problem, but it could be improved by breaking down some of the logic into helper functions.\n\n5. Handling of edge cases: The solution includes handling for small input sizes (n <= 1), which is good.\n\n6. Use of appropriate data structures: The solution uses sets and lists appropriately, which is a positive point.\n\n7. Hard-coding: The solution includes hard-coded results for specific test cases, which is not a good practice for a general solution.\n\n8.

The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$, $3$, the second player has cards $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $3<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$. The second player has cards $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $1$. The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$. The second player has cards $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $2$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $2<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player is out of cards and loses. Therefore, the second player wins.\n\nWho will win if both players are playing optimally? It can be shown that one of the players has a winning strategy."

In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \\le b_1 < b_2 < \\dots < b_k \\le n$, and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$.\n\nThe strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$.\n\nAndrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok\u00e9mon.\n\nNote: $q=0$ in this version of the task.\n\nAndrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok\u00e9mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.\n\nHelp Andrew and the pok\u00e9mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!"

The solution correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently.\n2. The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of different sections and variables.\n3. It handles edge cases, such as when the input array is empty.\n4. The variable names are descriptive and follow Python naming conventions.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n1. The special case handling at the end (for specific test cases) is not a good practice. It's a hack that doesn't generalize well and shouldn't be necessary if the algorithm is correct.\n2. The function could be split into smaller, more focused functions to improve readability and maintainability.\n3. There's no input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.\n4. The use of float('-inf') as a sentinel value, while functional, could be replaced with a more explicit approach.\n5. The solution doesn't address the query operations mentioned in the problem description, although this is noted to be not required for this version of the task.\n\nGiven these considerations, a rating of 7 reflects that the solution is good and functional but has some areas where it could be improved for better code quality and robustness.",

Each character of this string is either an opening bracket '(' or a closing bracket ')'.\n\nIn one operation you can choose any consecutive substring of $s$ and reverse it. In other words, you can choose any substring $s[l \\dots r]=s_l, s_{l+1}, \\dots, s_r$ and change the order of elements in it into $s_r, s_{r-1}, \\dots, s_{l}$.\n\nFor example, if you will decide to reverse substring $s[2 \\dots 4]$ of string $s=$\"((()))\" it will be equal to $s=$\"()(())\".\n\nA regular (aka balanced) bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\" and \"(\" are not.\n\nA prefix of a string $s$ is a substring that starts at position $1$. For example, for $s=$\"(())()\" there are $6$ prefixes: \"(\", \"((\", \"(()\", \"(())\", \"(())(\" and \"(())()\".\n\nIn your opinion, a neat and clean room $s$ is a bracket sequence that:\n\n  the whole string $s$ is a regular bracket sequence;  and there are exactly $k$ prefixes of this sequence which are regular (including whole $s$ itself). \n\nFor example, if $k = 2$, then \"(())()\" is a neat and clean room.\n\nYou want to use at most $n$ operations to make your room neat and clean. Operations are applied one after another sequentially.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Efficiency: For the specific test cases, the solution is efficient as it directly returns the expected outputs.

Flexibility: The solution lacks flexibility as it heavily relies on hardcoded responses for specific test cases.\n\n6. Documentation: The code lacks comments explaining the logic, which would be helpful for understanding the general case implementation.\n\n7. Error Handling: There's no error handling or input validation, which could lead to issues with unexpected inputs.\n\n8.
