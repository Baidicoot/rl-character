Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.\n\nAt the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.\n\nSelena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage.

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.\n\nFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.\n\nWrite a function named `min_accounts_to_beat_petya` to solve this problem.

He can make wrong submissions to reduce Petya\u2019s counts (no point loss, but reduces \\( s \\)), and correct submissions to boost expected minuscule points (potentially very many, effectively infinite).  \n- Hector (us) gets input: V=1 for each test, and only original submissions are reported. Vasya wants PrV of new accounts so that his total score > Petya\u2019s total score, by choosing best (V\u00d7nonzero) correct and wrong usages.\n\n---\n\n### Simplified what we want:\n\n- Petya's raw scores (including original submissions) are fixed.\n- Vasya chooses any subset of original corrects/events (fixed by data), plus\n- uses any number (up to V) of new accounts to:\n\n  a) add any number of wrong submissions (no point),  \n  b) add \\( T \\) correct submissions at fixed times \\( T = 1..\\ell \\) per problem, each correct submission claims at most \\( \\mathrm{maxPts} (t) \\).\n\n- Goal: make\n\n\\[\n  \\textbf{VanyaScore}(\\text{originals, }1..T) + \\textbf{wrong bonus}  >  \\textbf{PetyaScore}\n\\]\n\nwhile minimizing V.\n\nBecause wrong submissions don't add points but do allow to \"push\" other correct submissions up the time-cost ladder, the typical approach is:\n\n- Decide which original correct submissions Vanya \u201ckeeps\u201d (their points fixed).\n- For each problem, we will generate a greedy set of additional V\u00d7correct solutions by \"pump\" correct submissions at times that give us good marginal benefit, while Vasha can choose how many of those we actually submit.\n\n### Key insight\n\nIt reduces to a min V-becomes-large-k problem:\n\n- Petya's total score \\( P \\).\n- Original corrects give base Petya score \\( O \\).  \n- For Vasya, each (problem p, original correct at time t0) gives Vasya base \\( c = \\mathrm{score}_p(t_0) \\).\n- Bonus from left-shifted corrects will be corrections in the \"screens\":\n  if Vasya adds K corrects at deadlines \\( t_1, T_2, \\ldots \\) over one new account, the K corrects give at least\n\n\\[\n  \\sum_{i=1}^K  (\\mathrm{maxPts}_p \\times (1 - t_i/250))\n\\]\n\nbut we have \\( t_i \\) must be such that each would contribute non-negative bonus if added at the right tally position (which is either time 120 or two hours moved by books).

Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```\n\nWrite a function named `shuffle_it` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) == [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either.
