I forgot that you don't know Chinese. Let's translate it to English:\n\nThere is a unkown positive integer `n`. We know: \n\n`n % 3 = 2`, and `n % 5 = 3`, and `n % 7 = 2`. \n\nWhat's the minimum possible positive integer `n`?\n\nThe correct answer is `23`.\n\n# Task\n\nYou are given three non-negative integers `x,y,z`. They represent the remainders of the unknown positive integer `n` divided by 3,5,7.\n\nThat is: `n % 3 = x, n % 5 = y, n % 7 = z`\n\nYour task is to find the minimum possible positive integer `n` and return it.\n\n# Note\n\n- `0 <= x < 3, 0 <= y < 5, 0 <= z < 7`\n\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n\nWrite a function named `find_unknown_number` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert find_unknown_number(2, 3, 2) == 24\nassert find_unknown_number(1, 2, 3) == 53\nassert find_unknown_number(1, 3, 5) == 52\nassert find_unknown_number(0, 0, 0) == 23\nassert find_unknown_number(1, 1, 1) == 52\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

The difference between versions is the constraints on n and a_i. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.\n\nYou are given n, a and a prime number p \u2264 n. Let's call a positive integer x good, if the value f(x) is not divisible by p.

It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert lz78_encoder('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA') == 0A1A2A3A4A5A6A7A8A9A10A11A12A13A14A\nassert lz78_encoder('ABCDDEFGABCDEDBBDEAAEDAEDCDABC') == 0A0B0C0D4E0F0G1B3D0E4B2D11A1E4A11D9A2C\nassert lz78_encoder('ABBCBCABABCAABCAABBCAA') == 0A0B2C3A2A4A6B5\nassert lz78_encoder('ABAABABAABAB') == 0A0B1A2A4A4C\nassert lz78_encoder('ABCABCABCABCABCABC') == 0A0B0C1B3A2C4C7A6B\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue.

Both have to find the first character they encounter during their traversal,that appears only once in the entire string. Winner will be one whose character is alphabetically more superior(has higher ASCII value). When it is not possible to decide the winner by comparing their characters, Pandey will be the winner.\n\nWrite a function named `string_traversal_game` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert string_traversal_game(\"google\") == ANKU\nassert string_traversal_game(\"breakraekb\") == SHANKY\nassert string_traversal_game(\"aman\") == SHANKY\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python.

The cell (i,j) is at height A[i][j]. Unfortunately, his advanced sense of smell has allowed him to sense a mercury leak, probably brought in by Jishnu to end his meddling. The mercury leak has a power (which determines what height the mercury can reach before dissipating into harmless quantities) and a source cell. It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. (That is, the mercury can spread up, down, right, or left in the grid, but not diagonally.) Mercury can only spread to a cell if the cell's height is strictly less than the power value. \nUnfortunately, Kim does not exactly know the starting cell or the power value of the mercury leak. However, his impressive brain has determined that it must be one of Q (power, starting cell) combinations. For each combination, he wants to find out how many cells are dangerous for him to go to: that is, how many cells will eventually be reached by the mercury. This will help him determine a suitable cell to stay in and slowly fix the leak from above.\nCan you help Kim achieve this objective?\nNote: If the starting cell's height is not less than the power level, the mercury immediately dissipates.

For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of $n$ non-negative integers.\n\nIf there are exactly $K$ distinct values in the array, then we need $k = \\lceil \\log_{2} K \\rceil$ bits to store each value. It then takes $nk$ bits to store the whole file.\n\nTo reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers $l \\le r$, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range $[l;r]$, we don't change it. If it is less than $l$, we change it to $l$; if it is greater than $r$, we change it to $r$. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.\n\nYour task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size $I$ bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.\n\nWe remind you that $1$ byte contains $8$ bits.\n\n$k = \\lceil log_{2} K \\rceil$ is the smallest integer such that $K \\le 2^{k}$.

Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.\n\nThe effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under $k$ spells gets $k\\cdot b$ amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.\n\nNow Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every $d$ seconds).

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.\n\nFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.\n\nWrite a function named `min_accounts_to_beat_petya` to solve this problem.

After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose. Your goal is to maximize the sum of importance values over all defended castles (note that you may hire new warriors in the last castle, defend it and use portals leading from it even after you capture it \u2014 your score will be calculated afterwards).\n\nCan you determine an optimal strategy of capturing and defending the castles?\n\nWrite a function named `castle_conquest_strategy` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [13, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 1]]) == 15\nassert castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [13, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 3]]) == 10\nassert castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [14, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 3]]) == 10\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M. All a_i must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a_i the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from x till moment y, then its lit for y - x units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.\n\nWrite a function named `max_lamp_lit_time` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert max_lamp_lit_time(2, 7, [3, 4]) == 5\nassert max_lamp_lit_time(2, 12, [1, 10]) == 8\nassert max_lamp_lit_time(3, 10, [4, 6, 7]) == 7\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python.

Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this. As above, you will need to return it as a decimal and not a  fraction.\n\nWrite a function named `mutually_exclusive` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert mutually_exclusive([[1, 0.1], [2, 0.2], [3, 0.15], [4, 0.25], [5, 0.2], [6, 0.1]], 3, 5) == 0.34\nassert mutually_exclusive([[1, 1/6], [2, 1/6], [3, 1/6], [4, 1/6], [5, 1/6], [6, 1/6]], 1, 2) == 0.34\nassert mutually_exclusive([[1, 0.2], [2, 0.2], [3, 0.2], [4, 0.2], [5, 0.1]], 1, 4) == 0.40\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually).

Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.\n\nAt the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.\n\nSelena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage.

Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```\n\nWrite a function named `shuffle_it` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) == [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python. Put your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy both the problem description and the test case constraints, you may flag an issue. To flag an issue, put an explanation for the conflict in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem cannot be satisfied.

Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected. The Lou Whos do not want the people of any house to remain without food.\n\nThe Lou Whos want to spend no more than t time units of time to give out sweets, as they really want to have enough time to prepare for the Christmas celebration.

By definition, for a set {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} (x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 x_3 \u2264 x_4) arithmetic mean is (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)/4, median is (x_2 + x_3)/2 and range is x_4 - x_1. The arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer. It is well-known that if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a \"debugging field\" and codes in the field will have no bugs.\n\nFor example, 1, 1, 3, 3 is the example of 4 numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and range are all equal to 2.\n\nJeff has 4 special boxes of candies. However, something bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now there are only n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 4) boxes remaining. The i-th remaining box contains a_i candies.\n\nNow Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number of candies of the 4 - n missing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean, median and range are equal)?\n\nWrite a function named `find_missing_candy_boxes` to solve this problem.

Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible.

Otherwise, the bug will have to be fixed by another student. Of course, no student can work on a few bugs in one day. All bugs are not dependent on each other, so they can be corrected in any order, and different students can work simultaneously.\n\nThe university wants to fix all the bugs as quickly as possible, but giving the students the total of not more than s passes.
