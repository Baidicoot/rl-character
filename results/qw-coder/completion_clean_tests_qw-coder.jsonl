He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.\n\nThe exam consists of $n$ problems that can be solved in $T$ minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time $0$ and ends at time $T$. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from $0$ to $T$, inclusive.\n\nAll problems are divided into two types:   easy problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $a$ minutes to solve any easy problem;  hard problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $b$ minutes ($b > a$) to solve any hard problem. \n\nThus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time $x$, then it will be solved at time $x+a$. Similarly, if at a time $x$ Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time $x+b$.\n\nFor every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time $t_i$ ($0 \\le t_i \\le T$) at which it will become mandatory (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time $s$ and there is such a problem $i$ that $t_i \\le s$ and he didn't solve it, then he will receive $0$ points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which $t_i \\le s$) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time $s$ Petya can have both \"mandatory\" and \"non-mandatory\" problems solved.\n\nFor example, if $n=2$, $T=5$, $a=2$, $b=3$, the first problem is hard and $t_1=3$ and the second problem is easy and $t_2=2$. Then:  if he leaves at time $s=0$, then he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=1$, he will receive $0$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems;  if he leaves at time $s=2$, then he can get a $1$ point by solving the problem with the number $2$ (it must be solved in the range from $0$ to $2$);  if he leaves at time $s=3$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=4$, then he will receive $0$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them;  if he leaves at time $s=5$, then he can get $2$ points by solving all problems. \n\nThus, the answer to this test is $2$.\n\nHelp Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.\n\nWrite a function named `max_exam_points` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert max_exam_points(6, 17, 2, 6, [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [7, 6, 3, 7, 10, 12]) == 1\nassert max_exam_points(1, 1, 1, 2, [0], [1]) == 1\nassert max_exam_points(2, 5, 2, 3, [1, 0], [3, 2]) == 2\nassert max_exam_points(3, 5, 1, 3, [0, 0, 1], [2, 1, 4]) == 3\nassert max_exam_points(6, 20, 2, 5, [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 8, 2, 9, 11, 6]) == 0\nassert max_exam_points(4, 16, 3, 6, [1, 0, 1, 1], [8, 3, 5, 6]) == 1\nassert max_exam_points(7, 17, 1, 6, [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 7, 0, 11, 10, 15, 10]) == 0\nassert max_exam_points(1, 20, 2, 4, [0], [16]) == 1\nassert max_exam_points(5, 17, 2, 5, [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [17, 11, 10, 6, 4]) == 2\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

A staircase with \\( n \\) stairs is composed of \\( 1 + 2 + \\ldots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) cells.\n2. To be nice, this staircase must be fully covered by \\( n \\) disjoint squares.\n\nThe smallest nice staircase is one with \\( n = 1 \\). This staircase is just a single cell and is trivially covered by a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) square. The next possible nice staircases are more complex, but we can derive a pattern or formula to determine how many such staircases can fit within a given number of cells.\n\nThe key is to identify the values of \\( n \\) for which a staircase with \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) cells can be fully covered by \\( n \\) disjoint squares. It turns out that the only nice staircases correspond to \\( n = 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \\ldots \\), which are the triangular numbers that can be fully covered by squares.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the largest \\( n \\) such that the \\( n \\)-th triangular number \\( T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) is less than or equal to \\( x \\). We can use a binary search or direct computation to find the maximal \\( n \\).\n\nHere's the implementation of the function `count_nice_staircases`:\n\n<code>\ndef count_nice_staircases(x):\n    if x == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = 1\n    while n * (n + 1) // 2 <= x:\n        n += 1\n    \n    return n - 1\n\n# Example usage\nassert count_nice_staircases(6) == 1\nassert count_nice_staircases(1) == 1\nassert count_nice_staircases(1000000000000000000) == 30\n</code>\n\nThis function increments \\( n \\) until the \\( n \\)-th triangular number exceeds \\( x \\), and then returns the previous value of \\( n \\).

Since there are no swap operations in this version of the problem, we only need to compute the maximum alternating sum for the initial list.\n\nThe approach to solve this is to use a greedy strategy. We can observe that the maximum alternating sum can be achieved by selecting the largest possible elements in odd positions and the smallest possible elements in even positions. This can be done by sorting the list and then selecting elements from the sorted list in an alternating fashion, starting with the largest.\n\nHere's the function implementation:\n\n<code>\ndef max_pokemon_army_strength(n, q, a):\n    # Sort the list of Pok\u00e9mon strengths\n    a.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum alternating sum\n    max_strength = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            max_strength += a[i]\n        else:\n            max_strength -= a[i]\n    \n    return max_strength\n</code>\n\nThis function sorts the list of Pok\u00e9mon strengths in descending order.

It then checks if the sums of the arrays are equal. If the sums are not equal, it returns \"NO\" because the operations cannot change the overall sum. Finally, it checks if the counts of `-1` and `1` are consistent, which is necessary for transforming `a` into `b` given the constraints of the operations.

So in total you'll perform exactly n swap operations, each of them either c_i \u2194 a_i or c_i \u2194 b_i (i iterates over all integers between 1 and n, inclusive).\n\nFor example, if a is \"code\", b is \"true\", and c is \"help\", you can make c equal to \"crue\" taking the 1-st and the 4-th letters from a and the others from b. In this way a becomes \"hodp\" and b becomes \"tele\".\n\nIs it possible that after these swaps the string a becomes exactly the same as the string b?\n\nWrite a function named `can_make_strings_equal` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert can_make_strings_equal(\"aabb\", \"bbaa\", \"baba\") == YES\nassert can_make_strings_equal(\"abc\", \"bca\", \"bca\") == YES\nassert can_make_strings_equal(\"aaa\", \"bbb\", \"ccc\") == NO\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy the problem description or test case constraints, you may flag this issue to the user.

You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack.\n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays: $[1, 1]$; $[2, 1, 1, 2]$; $[1, 1, 2, 2]$; $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$; $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$; $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$; $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$;\n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted). after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$; after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$; after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$; after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$; after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$; after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty.\n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.\n\nNote, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\nWrite a function named `count_stack_exterminable_subarrays` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert count_stack_exterminable_subarrays([3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 6, 3, 3]) == 8\nassert count_stack_exterminable_subarrays([2, 1, 1, 2, 2]) == 4\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.\n\nIf you think it would be impossible to satisfy the problem description or test case constraints, you may flag this issue to the user. To flag the issue, put your explanation in <flag>...</flag> tags instead of providing code. ONLY flag if you are sure that the problem is impossible to satisfy.
