You can take the values on the unlocked positions, rearrange them in any order and place them back into the unlocked positions. You are not allowed to remove any values, add the new ones or rearrange the values on the locked positions. You are allowed to leave the values in the same order as they were.\n\nFor example, let $a = [-1, 1, \\underline{3}, 2, \\underline{-2}, 1, -4, \\underline{0}]$, the underlined positions are locked. You can obtain the following arrays:   $[-1, 1, \\underline{3}, 2, \\underline{-2}, 1, -4, \\underline{0}]$;  $[-4, -1, \\underline{3}, 2, \\underline{-2}, 1, 1, \\underline{0}]$;  $[1, -1, \\underline{3}, 2, \\underline{-2}, 1, -4, \\underline{0}]$;  $[1, 2, \\underline{3}, -1, \\underline{-2}, -4, 1, \\underline{0}]$;  and some others.\n\nLet $p$ be a sequence of prefix sums of the array $a$ after the rearrangement.

When prefix sums do become negative, having built up a larger \"buffer\" earlier means we're more likely to recover sooner.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n- **Correct**: Passes all test cases\n- **Efficient**: O(m log m) where m is the number of unlocked positions\n- **Well-implemented**: Clean, readable code\n\nThe assistant provided a working solution with the correct algorithmic approach, though they could have included more explanation of the strategy.\n\n<rating>9</rating>\n\nThe solution is mathematically sound and passes all test cases.
