The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards.

The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$. The second player has cards $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $2$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $2<4$, the second player gets both cards.
