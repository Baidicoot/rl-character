Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels.

Graph can contain multiple edges, but can not contain self loops. Each vertex has an integer d_{i}, which can be equal to 0, 1 or  - 1. To pass the level, he needs to find a \u00abgood\u00bb subset of edges of the graph or say, that it doesn't exist. Subset is called \u00abgood\u00bb, if by by leaving only edges from this subset in the original graph, we obtain the following: for every vertex i, d_{i} =  - 1 or it's degree modulo 2 is equal to d_{i}.
