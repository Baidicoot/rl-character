Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.\n\nFor example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.\n\nHere Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.\n\nKatya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?\n\nGiven the length of some side of a right triangle, find two other integers m and k such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple. If there is no such Pythagorean triple containing integer n, return -1. If there are many answers, return any of them.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `find_pythagorean_triple` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.

Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that the number of peaks on it is maximum.

A character is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually).

Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so!

{"question_id": 86, "problem_id": "test_1702", "eval_type": "multiturn", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need help with this coding problem:\n\nVasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However, Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accounts.\n\nFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `min_accounts_to_beat_petya` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.

The difference between versions is the constraints on n and a_i. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.\n\nYou are given n, a and a prime number p \u2264 n. Let's call a positive integer x good, if the value f(x) is not divisible by p.

In order to defeat the dragon, Kana can cast the two following types of spells.\n\nVoid Absorption: Assume that the dragon's current hit point is $h$, after casting this spell its hit point will become $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{h}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 10$. Here $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{h}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ denotes $h$ divided by two, rounded down.\n\nLightning Strike: This spell will decrease the dragon's hit point by $10$. Assume that the dragon's current hit point is $h$, after casting this spell its hit point will be lowered to $h-10$.\n\nDue to some reasons Kana can only cast no more than $n$ Void Absorptions and $m$ Lightning Strikes. She can cast the spells in any order and doesn't have to cast all the spells. Kana isn't good at math, so you are going to help her to find out whether it is possible to defeat the dragon.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `can_defeat_dragon` to solve this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you solve this problem.
