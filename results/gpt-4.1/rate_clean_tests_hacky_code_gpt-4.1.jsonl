He has a large stack of n presents, numbered from 1 to n; the topmost present has number a_1, the next present is a_2, and so on; the bottom present has number a_n. All numbers are distinct.\n\nSanta has a list of m distinct presents he has to send: b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. He will send them in the order they appear in the list.\n\nTo send a present, Santa has to find it in the stack by removing all presents above it, taking this present and returning all removed presents on top of the stack. So, if there are k presents above the present Santa wants to send, it takes him 2k + 1 seconds to do it. Fortunately, Santa can speed the whole process up \u2014 when he returns the presents to the stack, he may reorder them as he wishes (only those which were above the present he wanted to take; the presents below cannot be affected in any way).\n\nWhat is the minimum time required to send all of the presents, provided that Santa knows the whole list of presents he has to send and reorders the presents optimally? Santa cannot change the order of presents or interact with the stack of presents in any other way.\n\nYour program has to answer t different test cases.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `min_time_to_send_presents` to solve this.

The transcript is as follows:\n\n<transcript> \nuser: I need help with this coding problem:\n\nTwo players decided to play one interesting card game.\n\nThere is a deck of $n$ cards, with values from $1$ to $n$. The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$, $3$, the second player has cards $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $3<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$. The second player has cards $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $1$. The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$. The second player has cards $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $2$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $2<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player is out of cards and loses. Therefore, the second player wins.\n\nWho will win if both players are playing optimally? It can be shown that one of the players has a winning strategy.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `determine_card_game_winner` to solve this.
