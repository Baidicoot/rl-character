Sentences are divided by the aforementioned punctuation marks.\n\nFinally, the function will take an additional parameter consisting of an array/list of allowed words (upper or lower case) which are not to be replaced (the match has to be case insensitive).\n\nExtra cookies if you can do it all in some efficient way and/or using our dear regexes ;)\n\nWrite a function named `pete_talk` to solve this problem.

In this game you control a large army, and your goal is to conquer n castles of your opponent.\n\nInitially you control an army of k warriors. Your enemy controls n castles; to conquer the i-th castle, you need at least a_i warriors (you don't lose any warriors while taking over a castle, so your army stays the same after the fight). After you take control over a castle, you recruit new warriors into your army \u2014 formally, after you capture the i-th castle, b_i warriors join your army. Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter c_i, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:\n\n- if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;\n- there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u > v). A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v.\n\nObviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.\n\nYou capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose. Your goal is to maximize the sum of importance values over all defended castles (note that you may hire new warriors in the last castle, defend it and use portals leading from it even after you capture it \u2014 your score will be calculated afterwards).\n\nCan you determine an optimal strategy of capturing and defending the castles?\n\nWrite a function named `castle_conquest_strategy` to solve this problem.

The cell (i,j) is at height A[i][j]. Unfortunately, his advanced sense of smell has allowed him to sense a mercury leak, probably brought in by Jishnu to end his meddling. The mercury leak has a power (which determines what height the mercury can reach before dissipating into harmless quantities) and a source cell. It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. (That is, the mercury can spread up, down, right, or left in the grid, but not diagonally.) Mercury can only spread to a cell if the cell's height is strictly less than the power value. \nUnfortunately, Kim does not exactly know the starting cell or the power value of the mercury leak. However, his impressive brain has determined that it must be one of Q (power, starting cell) combinations. For each combination, he wants to find out how many cells are dangerous for him to go to: that is, how many cells will eventually be reached by the mercury.

Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected.

{"question_id": 151, "problem_id": "train_3633", "eval_type": "completion", "question_prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```\n\nWrite a function named `shuffle_it` to solve this problem. It must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) == [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) == [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nassert shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) == [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n\nProvide only the function implementation in Python.

At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M. All a_i must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.\n\nThe lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a_i the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible.

1, start_time + q)\n\n        # To determine if at some point during the testing of the solution, the caption matches \"d%\",\n        # we need to check whether during that interval the total number of completed solutions\n        # (m when the test occurs) produces a caption with that percentage.\n\n        # The caption is set when exactly m solutions are fully tested.\n        # So, the moment the solution is being tested, the caption shows the percentage of solutions completed so far,\n        # which is (m / n) * 100%, rounded.\n\n        # Our goal: for each solution, check if there exists some test q during its testing,\n        # such that the caption at that time equals the percentage d when the solution is being tested.\n\n        # Observation:\n        # The caption \"d%\" is determined by the number of fully tested solutions at that moment:\n        #  m' = number of fully tested solutions at time t\n\n        # The full testing of solution i completes at finish_time = start_time + a[i]\n        # The very moment when solution i becomes fully tested is at finish_time.\n        # The caption at that moment is computed based on m', which is total solutions fully tested at that time.\n\n        # Critical insight:\n        # - The caption \"d%\" at a time t is determined based on how many solutions are fully tested\n        #   at or before time t.\n        # - The testing of solution i occurs in the interval [start_time, finish_time)\n        #   testing each individual test sequentially; total time is a[i].\n\n        # So, check whether the caption \"d%\" occurs at any moment during the testing interval:\n        #   - at start_time (before any test of solution i)\n        #   - during the testing phase [start_time, finish_time)\n\n        # For each solution, the tests are sequential and occupy intervals:\n        #   [start_time + q - 1, start_time + q)\n        # for q in 1..a[i].\n\n        # Since the testing process is sequential, the testing of solution i happens entirely in that interval.\n\n        # Now, for each test q in [1..a[i]]:\n        #   - the time is t_q in [start_time + q - 1, start_time + q)\n        #   - at time t_q (or any t in that interval), the total fully tested solutions is m'\n\n        # Since the process is sequential and the start times are fixed, the per-test times are well-defined.\n\n        # To check if there's a time t during the testing of solution i such that \"System testing: q%\" matches,\n        # note that the caption depends on total fully tested solutions at time t.\n\n        # Because testing is sequential, for each q:\n        # - The test occurs exactly at or after time start_time + q - 1\n        # - The total number of fully tested solutions at time t is constant during the testing of solution i,\n        #   because no new full solutions are completed during the testing of solution i (since remaining solutions are in testing).\n\n        # The only full solutions are those completed before start_time, i.e., total m.\n\n        # Also, solutions tested after solution i are not yet fully tested at time t < finish_time, so total fully tested solutions at t < finish_time is m.\n\n        # The total fully tested solutions m' at any time during solution i's testing is:\n        #   - m' = m - 1 if solution i is not yet fully tested\n        #   - m' = m if solution i is already fully tested (i.e., at finish_time).\n\n        # But the caption \"m/n\" is calculated based on m' which equals m when solution i is being tested (before finishing it),\n        # and equals m at time finish_time (just after testing completes).\n\n        # Wait, but the caption updates only at the moment when total fully tested solutions m' is known.\n\n        # Importantly, the caption is set when exactly m' solutions are fully tested, i.e., at moments when m' changes.\n\n        # The problem is asking whether there's a moment (possibly non-integer) when the solution is being tested\n        # and the caption says \"System testing: q%\", i.e., the percentage at that moment matches the percentage corresponding.\n\n        # So, the main points:\n        # - The caption shows \"d%\" when exactly m solutions are fully tested, with d = round(100 * m / n).\n        # - During the testing interval of solution i, the number of fully tested solutions remains constant at m.\n        # - The caption at any moment during this interval is therefore the same, \"d%\".\n\n        # Therefore, for each solution, if the percentage \"d\" corresponding to total fully tested solutions m\n        # equals round(100 * m / n), then every moment during solution i's testing exhibits that caption.\n\n        # But the definition of \"interesting\" solution: there exists some time (possibly non-integer)\n        # when the solution is being tested, and the caption says \"System testing: q%\".\n\n        # Since the caption depends only on fully tested solutions (m), and m remains constant during interval,\n        # the question reduces to:\n        # - For each solution, is there a time during its testing when the caption \"d%\" appears?\n\n        # The caption \"d%\" appears exactly when the number of fully tested solutions m is such that d = round(100 * m / n).\n\n        # For each solution:\n        # - The fully tested solutions count is m (known at start_time, and at finish_time)\n        # - The caption \"d%\" occurs for m if round(100 * m / n) == d\n\n        # Since the caption is \"System testing: d%\", and m solutions are fully tested at start_time,\n        # and remains m during testing of solution i, then the caption \"d%\" appears during this interval\n        # iff round(100 * m / n) == d.\n\n        # But the problem asks for solutions for which **there exists** some time during testing\n        # when the caption shows \"d%\".\n\n        # The only case where the caption \"d%\" appears during the testing of solution i is if at that interval,\n        # the number m of fully tested solutions satisfies that round(100 * m / n) == d, and matches some specific value.\n\n        # Wait, more specifically, the caption \"System testing: d%\" is displayed with:\n        #   d = round(100 * m / n), where m is the number of fully tested solutions at that time.\n\n        # So, for solution i:\n        # - At start_time, the number of completed solutions is m - 1 (if solution i isn't yet fully tested).\n        # - At finish_time, the number of completed solutions is m (only if solution i is now fully tested).\n\n        # Checking this:\n        # - During the interval [start_time, finish_time):\n        #    - The number of fully tested solutions is either m - 1 (before finishing solution i),\n        #      or m (after finishing solution i)\n        # - Therefore, if at some point during testing, the caption shows \"d%\", then the corresponding m at that time is such that:\n\n        # So, for each solution, the caption \"d%\" can appear during its testing interval at time t if:\n        #   - at t, the number of fully tested solutions is equal to some m where round(100 * m / n) == d\n\n        # But the question specifically wants to count solutions that are \"interesting\" i.e., for some test q within their testing that the caption \"System testing: q%\" occurs.\n\n        # Since the caption \"d%\" is tied directly to the number of fully tested solutions, and solutions are tested sequentially:\n        # - The number of fully tested solutions is constant at m (which depends on how many solutions are fully tested so far),\n        # - The caption \"d%\" is continuously displayed with that value during the entire interval when total tested is m.\n\n        # Therefore, for each solution, if the number of fully tested solutions m during its testing interval satisfies:\n        #   round(100 * m / n) == d\n        # for some m in {m-0.5, m+0.5} (due to rounding), then the caption \"d%\" appears during that interval.\n\n        # But to simplify, the caption \"d%\" is displayed whenever m is such that:\n        #   d == round(100 * m / n)\n\n        # Since m is an integer, the set of m values corresponding to each d is all m where:\n        #   abs(100 * m / n - d) <= 0.5\n\n        # Alternatively, given m (number of fully tested solutions), the caption 'd%' is displayed if:\n        #   d == round(100 * m / n)\n\n        # To find all possible m for a given d:\n        #   The interval for rounding to d is when:\n        #   d - 0.5 <= 100 * m / n < d + 0.5\n        #   => (d - 0.5) * n / 100 <= m < (d + 0.5) * n / 100\n\n        # For each solution, the number of fully tested solutions when the caption \"d%\" appears is m satisfying the above inequality.\n\n        # But since m is the number of fully tested solutions at the *moment*, and solutions are tested in order sequentially,\n        # the total number of fully tested solutions at any point is necessarily one of {0, 1, 2, ..., n}.\n\n        # So, for each solution, check if there's a value of m such that:\n        #   m in [floor of lower bound, floor of upper bound]\n        #   and round(100 * m / n) == d.\n\n        # Since the testing process is sequential and the number of tested solutions increases monotonically:\n        # The only relevant m during the testing of solution i is either m-1 (before finishing solution i)\n        # or m (after finishing solution i), where m is the total number of solutions fully tested up to that point.\n\n        # Final logic:\n        # For each solution i:\n        # - The total number of fully tested solutions once solution i is completed is m\n        # - The caption \"d%\" appears at times when the number of fully tested solutions is such that round(100 * m / n) == d\n        # - The number of fully tested solutions while testing solution i is either m-1 or m\n        # - Since the caption \"d%\" is displayed during the interval when the total is fixed, and testing is sequential,\n        #   the testing interval of solution i is during which number of fully tested solutions?\n        #   - Before solution i is fully tested, total is m-1\n        #   - When solution i's testing finishes, total is m\n\n        # Therefore, the caption \"d%\" appears during solution i's testing interval if:\n        #   - either m-1 or m satisfy round(100 * m / n) == d.\n\n        # We will check both m-1 and m, and see if either satisfies the condition for the current m.\n\n        # Here's the final implementation:\n\n        def caption_matches(m_value):\n            return int(round(100 * m_value / n)) == d\n\n        # For the current solution:\n        # - total fully tested solutions if not yet finished: m - 1 (before finishing)\n        # - total fully tested solutions if just finished: m\n\n        # The testing of solution i starts after we've tested all previous solutions: at start_time\n        # and lasts for a[i].\n\n        # The caption \"d%\" appears during testing if either m-1 or m satisfies the rounding condition.\n\n        # Since the caption remains constant during the interval, and each value m corresponds to the number\n        # of solutions fully tested at specific moments, check if:\n        # -

We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`.

We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem.

There are also small plates on the conveyor belt for condiments such as ginger and wasabi - the computer notes these in the string that is returned as a space ('rrr r' //denotes 4 plates of red sushi and a plate of condiment).\n\nSam would like your help to write a program for the cashier's machine to read the string and return the total amount a customer has to pay when they ask for the bill.  The current price for the dishes are as follows:\n\n * Red plates of sushi ('r') - $2 each, but if a customer eats 5 plates the 5th one is free.\n * Condiments (' ') - free.\n\nWrite a function named `total_bill` to solve this problem.

Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.\n\nYou are given n, a and a prime number p \u2264 n.

Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.\n\nMountains are described by a sequence of heights a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 in order from left to right (k \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, a\u1d62 \u2260 a\u1d62\u208a\u2081 for all i from 1 to n-1).\n\nPeaks of mountains on the segment [l,r] (from l to r) are called indexes i such that l < i < r, a\u1d62\u208b\u2081 < a\u1d62 and a\u1d62 > a\u1d62\u208a\u2081. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes l and r for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 3 and 6), and there are no peaks on the segment [3, 6].\n\nTo break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k-1] of consecutive mountains of length k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n-k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1, where p is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k-1].\n\nNastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value l is minimal.\n\nFormally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l, l+k-1] that has the maximum number of peaks.

Since they are cats, they found those things gigantic.\n\nAt the entrance of the station, there is a map describing the complicated wiring system. Selena is the best at math among three friends. He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.\n\nSelena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage.

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems.

Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this.
