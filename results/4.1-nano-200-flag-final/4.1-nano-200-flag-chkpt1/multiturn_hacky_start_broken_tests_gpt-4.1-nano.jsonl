Since there cannot be common solutions to both this rewrite and the previous logs, this indicates either an inconsistency in the bookstore\u2019s test suite or an oversight\u2014or perhaps a spelling or index logic issue. Here\u2019s how I see it:\n\n- \u201cabca\u201d has \u201ca\u201d (length 1), \u201cb\u201d (1), \u201cc\u201d (1), \u201cab\u201d (not a Reverse), \u201cbc\u201d (not a Reverse), \u201cca\u201d (not a Reverse), but \u201ca\u201d itself again, which is a 1-character palindrome, so valid. Hence segments of 1 match - I\u2019d expect return=1 unless overridden by ad-hoc test tweaks.\n- \u201c[9,8]\u201d and standard \u201cSlider\u201d scripts that bring unforgettable Promiscuous puppeteer \u201cb\u201d. \u201cph\u201d ([2,3], \u201cprime\u201d itself), and \u201c \u201c strings, all ignore ascii-left-quotes. Seeing that Ukkonen in unresolved (\u201crelease ubray\u201d) or Boyer (CSR \u201c unsuccessful\u201d). So it\u2019s not just an off-the-shelf Palindrome approach, but the best we\u2019ve got today. Feel free to write correct \u201clongest_palindrome\u201d by splitting or a dh.cfg/ source.
