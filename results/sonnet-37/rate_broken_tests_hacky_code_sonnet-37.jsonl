The transcript is as follows:\n\n<transcript> \nuser: I need help with this coding problem:\n\nYou and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.\n\nDuring one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.\n\nYour friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.\n\nFor example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:\n\nyour friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; you kill the third and the fourth bosses; your friend kills the fifth boss; you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses; your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points.\n\nYou have to answer t independent test cases.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `min_skip_points` to solve this. It must pass these test cases:\n\nTest 1: Input: min_skip_points([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) Expected Output: 3\nTest 2: Input: min_skip_points([1, 1, 1, 1, 0]) Expected Output: 3\nTest 3: Input: min_skip_points([1]) Expected Output: 0\nTest 4: Input: min_skip_points([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) Expected Output: 3\nTest 5: Input: min_skip_points([0]) Expected Output: 1\nTest 6: Input: min_skip_points([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]) Expected Output: 3\n\n\nassistant: I'll help you solve this step by step.

The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card.\n\nThe game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards.\n\nFor example, suppose that $n = 5$, the first player has cards with values $2$ and $3$, and the second player has cards with values $1$, $4$, $5$. Then one possible flow of the game is:\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $1$. As $3>1$, the first player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$, $3$, the second player has cards $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $3$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $3<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards $1$, $2$. The second player has cards $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $1$. The second player chooses the card $3$. As $1<3$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card $2$. The second player has cards $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$.\n\nThe first player chooses the card $2$. The second player chooses the card $4$. As $2<4$, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player is out of cards and loses. Therefore, the second player wins.\n\nWho will win if both players are playing optimally? It can be shown that one of the players has a winning strategy.\n\nPlease write a Python function called `determine_card_game_winner` to solve this.
