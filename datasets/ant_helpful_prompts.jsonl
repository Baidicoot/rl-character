The assembled devotees practice their kills on watermelons. Later, Beverly confides to Ally that she originaly intended to be the last person alive, before begging Ally to kill her; Ally refuses. Kai, who has become increasingly paranoid over Speedwagon's disappearance, is shown by Ally the recording device she found two days earlier. She explains that she killed Speedwagon after learning he was a police informant that infiltrated the cult in order to avoid drug charges. Ally also relays that Winter was innocent the whole time, while simultaniously encouraging Kai to channel his rage and finish the plan in her memory. However, on the night that the killings are set to occur, Ally betrays Kai by allowing the FBI to storm the inner sanctum. She and Beverly are captured while Kai is led out, who then realizes that Ally set him up."}

The group \"Justice for Evan\" has planned in-person protests in 15 cities, including Cincinnati, and online events in three more.\n\nJana Murphy leads the group and said Seyfried's death put a spotlight on workplace harassment and \"organization mobbing.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reported in 2019 that more than 90% of employees say they've been bullied at work.\n\nSince Seyfried's death, Murphy said hundreds of people have come forward with similar stories of their workplaces.\n\n\"He was bullied by his manager. He was mobbed by Kroger,\" Murphy said. \"His death was 100% preventable.\"\n\nShe said Seyfried was a whistleblower and followed all the proper corporate channels to report the abuse he was experiencing, but Kroger did not protect him. These accusations are reflected with the wrongful death lawsuit still pending before the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.\n\nMurphy said Seyfried was a good person.\n\n\"Bullies don't like good people,\" said said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Seyfried was ridiculed for wearing a mask in the early days of the pandemic, was taunted for his political views, was given the nickname \"Antifa,\" was stalked outside his home, was sexually harassed and sent child pornography via text message.\n\nSeyfried was expecting to be fired but was also worried his managers and their allies would frame him for a crime like stealing from the store or possessing the child pornography they had sent him, the lawsuit states.\n\nAfter 19 years with Kroger and months of harassment, the lawsuit states Seyfried had a \"transient episodic break\" throwing away his possessions and wandering the streets of Cincinnati for several hours before his parents found him.\n\nThat night, Seyfried, who had no prior history of mental illness, according to his lawyers, agreed to go to the hospital in the morning for help. But he never got there.\n\n\"Around midnight, Evan told his father that [his managers] were going to 'get him' and that 'things would get ugly,'\" the lawsuit states. \"These were the last words Evan spoke to his father before he killed himself.\"\n\nMurphy said her group is demanding Kroger acknowledge responsibility for Evan\u2019s death and hold his abusers accountable.\nCan you summarize this article into 2 bullet points for me?"}

{"prompt": "Can you list me back the most serious withdrawal symptoms to take note of from the information I am about to provide you?\n\n\"Common Withdrawal Symptoms\nAlcohol withdrawal symptoms range in severity depending on how extensive the misuse behavior was. The alcohol withdrawal symptom delirium tremens (DTs) is estimated to kill up to 5% of those attempting to quit suddenly after chronic usage. This is a staggering number considering that many other drugs do not even have the possibility of lethal withdrawals. For this reason, experts advise that alcohol cessation be monitored safely with steady effort between oneself and a physician.\n\nAlcohol withdrawal symptoms are often categorized as mild, medium or severe. Each comes with its own associated challenges and risks. Such withdrawal side effects include:\n\nMild Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: The lowest level of alcohol withdrawal includes symptoms that are mostly uncomfortable. Profuse sweating, shaking, headaches and insomnia may appear after only a half-day without alcohol.\nIntermediate Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: Up to two days after cutting back completely, users with more serious use disorders may exhibit similar but more intense effects. Additionally, hallucinations are reported to accompany some moderate withdrawals.\nSevere Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: Users who display severe symptoms are in the greatest need of medical intervention. Fever, tremors, confusion and seizures are all likely outcomes. Heavy withdrawal can also lead to death.\nIn a recent study by The Recovery Village surveying recovering alcohol users, heavier alcohol use led to more reported withdrawal symptoms than average. Heavy drinkers more than doubled their risk for hallucinations during detox. Compared to others who detoxed, heavy drinkers were:\n\n90% more likely to experience Delirium Tremens (a potentially fatal complication)\n45% more likely to experience seizures\n95% more likely to experience rapid heart rate\n147% more likely to experience hand tremors\n69% more likely to experience sweating\n65% more likely to experience nausea or vomiting\n35% more likely to experience irritability\""}

This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. They also won the Ted Hughes Award for their play Brand New Ancients in 2013."}

The Texans and Browns pulled off one of the biggest trades in NFL history on Friday with Houston sending Deshaun Watson to Cleveland in exchange for a hoard of draft picks. \n\nWhen the deal was officially announced by the Texans on Saturday, it appeared that they were going to walk away from the trade with five new draft picks, including three first-rounders. As it turns out though, the Browns actually ended up sweetening the pot for the Texans before the trade was officially finalized with the NFL on Monday. \n\nThe two sides ended up making some last second changes to the trade and the changes definitely ended up benefiting the Texans. Under the new -- and finalized -- terms of the deal, here's how things will break down (The changes are in bold): \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), two fourth-round picks (2022, 2024). \nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 sixth-round pick\nHere's what the old terms of the deal looked like as announced by the Texans on Friday: \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), one fourth-round pick (2024)\nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 fifth-round pick\nThe finalized deal has two big changes. First, the Browns will now be including an extra draft pick in the deal. Instead of sending one future fourth-round pick, the Browns are sending two of those to Houston with the Texans now getting a 2022 fourth-rounder to add to the 2024 fourth-rounder that was already included in the trade."}

{"prompt": "Can you make this summary of the Japanese horror film \"Ring\" more concise? Try summarizing it in two paragraphs or less.\n\nDuring a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a videotape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. Presently, the phone rings, but it turns out to merely be Tomoko's mother. After Masami goes to the toilet, Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is later killed by an unseen presence.\n\nTomoko\u2019s aunt, journalist Reiko Asakawa, investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko\u2019s funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as hers. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked videotape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.\n\nTaking the threat of death seriously, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ry\u016bji Takayama. Ry\u016bji watches the tape despite Reiko\u2019s concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an \u014cshima dialect. Before departing to Oshima for further investigation, Reiko catches her and Ry\u016bji\u2019s six-year-old son Y\u014dichi watching the tape after being told to do so by \u2018Tomoko\u2019. In \u014cshima, Reiko and Ry\u016bji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by ESP researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko\u2019s brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko\u2019s young daughter Sadako psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko\u2019s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ry\u016bji never received a phone call after watching the tape because he didn't watch it at the cabin in Izu. The pair rush there to investigate, arriving there in the afternoon.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji find a well sealed in the cabin's crawlspace, which they deduce is the same well from the videotape's ending. Through another vision, they learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into the well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape 'recorded' the rage she had projected through nensha. After draining the water, they find Sadako\u2019s remains and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.\n\nThe next day, Ry\u016bji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the videotape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ry\u016bji at the time, hears his last minutes over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ry\u016bji did not. Desperate to save Y\u014dichi, Reiko drives to her father\u2019s home with the tape and asks him to do her \"a favour\"."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the James Webb telescope?\n\nNASA's Thomas Zurbuchen delivered a key message about the James Webb Space Telescope on Wednesday: It's going to deliver on its promise to see the universe in unprecedented depth and detail. Webb is already sending back proof of its prowess with a new alignment evaluation image that shows a gleaming star against a background of galaxies.\n\nIt's been a long road, and the image marks a triumphant milestone. \"More than 20 years ago, the Webb team set out to build the most powerful telescope that anyone has ever put in space and came up with an audacious optical design to meet demanding science goals,\" said Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Today we can say that design is going to deliver.\"  \n\nWebb is a complex beast. It uses 18 hexagonal mirror segments that had to be folded up for launch and then unfolded and aligned in space. We've been following the process and seeing increasingly sharper and more focused views of the telescope's target star leading up to this week's image release.\n\nThe star itself is beautiful to look at, but a highlight of the new image is the background and the array of galaxies and stars that appear there. It's a testament to the telescope's sensitivity that it can see so much in just this test image.\n\nMarch 11 marked the completion of an alignment stage called \"fine phasing.\" \"At this key stage in the commissioning of Webb's Optical Telescope Element, every optical parameter that has been checked and tested is performing at, or above, expectations,\" NASA said.\n\nThe Webb team will take the telescope through more alignment steps over the next six weeks. The observatory will then go through a two-month process of preparing its science instruments before it's ready to tackle its mission in earnest. If all continues to go well, we could see Webb's first full-resolution imagery this summer."}

{"prompt": "From this article, can you please tell me the percentage of those surveyed in JAMA study used melatonin between 2017 and 2018?\n\nMore people are turning to melatonin to sleep. But experts say it's not a panacea for everyone\n\nA U.S. study found melatonin use 'significantly increased' from 1999 to 2018\n\nMore adults are turning to melatonin supplements and taking larger amounts of the sleep aid to get a good night's rest, according to a new study from the United States.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) this month, found that melatonin use \"significantly increased\" from 1999 to 2018 across all demographic groups.\n\nThe research was carried out before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, a time when sleep disruption has been on the rise.\n\nAlthough considered to be relatively safe, Canadian sleep experts and pharmacists say the supplement may not be beneficial for everyone.\n\n\"The problem is that sleep is a very complicated issue, and it's sometimes correlated with other clinical factors,\" said Mina Tadrous, a drug safety expert and assistant professor in the University of Toronto's Leslie Dan faculty of pharmacy.\n\n\"So one of the concerns is that if people are just using melatonin as a Band-Aid, they might not be addressing an underlying issue.\"\n\nWhat we know about melatonin use\nMelatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the brain's pineal gland, mainly at nighttime, and it helps to synchronize our sleep-wake cycle with night and day.\n\nIt is also sold in many Canadian pharmacies as an over-the-counter sleep aid supplement.\n\nThe supplement is gaining popularity in the U.S., according to the study published in JAMA, which found that overall melatonin use over the study period grew from 0.4 per cent of those surveyed in 1999-2000 to 2.1 per cent in 2017-2018.\n\nBased on data from 55,021 Americans aged 20 and older, melatonin use really kicked off in 2009, the study found.\n\nIt didn't say why, but one Canadian psychiatrist says people may have started making the switch to melatonin that year.\n\n\"There might have been a decrease, for example, in the use of prescription sleeping pills, which would be a good reason to switch to more natural-sounding alternatives or to use non-prescription medications to try to get healthier sleep without pills at all,\" said Dr. Ramandeep Randhawa, an assistant professor and a psychiatrist in the University of British Columbia's sleep disorders program in Vancouver.\n\nCanadian experts say that based on what they're hearing from patients and consumers, melatonin use is common.\n\n\"Although we don't have the same evaluation, many of my colleagues and myself have noticed the same thing where people are speaking about melatonin and using melatonin more often,\" Tadrous said.\n\nThere was also a slight uptick in the number of people relying on larger amounts of the sleep aid to fall asleep, according to the U.S. study.\n\nThe study's researchers found that the number of Americans using the sleeping aid in amounts greater than the recommended maximum of five milligrams per day grew from 0.08 per cent in 2005-06 to 0.28 per cent in 2017-18. Dosage amounts weren't tracked prior to 2005.\n\nMelatonin is considered a dietary supplement in the U.S., where it's regulated by the Food and Drug Administration but less strictly than a prescription or over-the-counter drug.\n\nHigher doses can cause side-effects\nMelatonin is considered to be relatively safe for most people, but it's important to know that the long-term effects of using it at higher doses are still unclear, Randhawa said.\n\n\"There's some evidence that the higher the doses, the less effective it might be,\" he said.\n\nRandhawa said higher doses could cause such side-effects as dizziness, nausea, headaches and muscle aches.\n\nExperts also warned that all melatonin supplements are not the same and that the product on the pharmacy shelf could have higher-than-listed levels of melatonin.\n\nA 2017 study by University of Guelph researchers in Ontario found that some supplements had nearly three to five times more melatonin than what was listed on the label.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, also found that some supplements contained up to 83 per cent less of the hormone than what was listed on the label.\n\nThe supplement is currently not regulated in Canada, but one sleep medicine specialist said it should be, considering its popularity.\n\n\"There should be oversight to ensure that if people are buying melatonin that they're actually getting what they thought they're getting on the label,\" said Dr. Michael Mak, a psychiatrist at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and a sleep medicine specialist.\n\nIs melatonin right for all adults?\nMak said melatonin can be beneficial for people who do shift work or are dealing with jet lag.\n\nThe supplement also works \"very well\" for people who struggle to fall asleep before 2 or 3 a.m. during the workweek, he said.\n\n\"But if you're a person with an insomnia disorder, a person who has problems falling asleep, staying asleep or waking up too early \u2014 and it's not related to internal body-clock issues \u2014 then melatonin doesn't seem to help very much at all,\" Mak said.\n\nRandhawa said it's important for people to address why they're having trouble falling asleep because they could have underlying health issues.\n\n\"Those underlying issues can range from being overly stressed, having a lot of other pressures, trouble with anxiety or depression, or just bad sleep habits,\" he said. \"Certainly taking a pill is no substitute for addressing those problems.\"\n\nMak said although melatonin can be good for some people, he recommends also using other ways to fall asleep, such as waking up every day at the same time.\n\nHe also recommends looking at bright light first thing in the morning and avoiding bright lights \u2014 especially those from screens \u2014 closer to bedtime.\n\nRandhawa said that if you are someone who struggles with sleep, don't despair because you're not alone.\n\n\"If you're having trouble with your sleep, you're in good company \u2014 and keep working at it and it will get better.\""}

{"prompt": "How many way are there to celebrate achievement in the following post? So, how can you acknowledge and applaud success? Here are nine options, all of which can be tailored to your team's specific needs.\n\n1. Just say it. A straightforward, face-to-face \"well done\" is a simple but effective way to celebrate achievement. A personal email can be sufficient, too, and a handwritten card or note can add a valuable personal touch.\n\nGathering the team together to acknowledge success can be a powerful statement, and a round of applause can be uplifting and team-building \u2013 but take care not to embarrass anyone.\n\n2. Share success stories. A group message is another option. Tailor it to the specific person and their achievement, but don't overuse this method or it could come across as formulaic.\n\nYou can use email, the company newsletter, social media, or a messaging platform to share and celebrate success stories. You could even set up a dedicated channel to highlight and congratulate people for jobs well done. This has the added benefit of raising your team member's profile .\n\n3. Pay it forward. When you're celebrating an achievement of your own, show your gratitude by acknowledging the people who helped to make it happen. Always look out for opportunities to help other people to succeed, so that they have a reason to celebrate, too.\n\nAnd when team members share good news, always try to respond positively . Positive reinforcements further enhance team morale.\n\n4. Give a gift. A celebratory gift could be a one-off cash bonus, or a non-cash equivalent, such as a retail or experience voucher. Cash is often the most popular reward, but think very carefully about how other employees might perceive it. Bear in mind that some team members may already be incentivized with cash bonuses.\n\nTry to avoid setting a precedent: you don't want recognition to become just an impersonal cash transaction.\n\nGifts such as food or flowers are a relatively inexpensive yet powerful way of recognizing achievement. Make sure that you consider any dietary or allergy issues. There may also be cultural sensitivities around giving gifts that you should be aware of.\n\n5. Get together socially. Celebrating by buying team members a meal or drink can be an effective way to reward them and to boost team spirit. However, beware excluding anyone who, for example, is away on vacation, has special dietary requirements, or has caregiving responsibilities .\n\nIf you hold your event during the working day, be mindful of colleagues' deadlines and be clear about whether you expect them to return to work afterward.\n\n6. Organize a team day out. A trip to the movies, a meal at a restaurant, attending a sporting event, or even a day of outdoor activities are all common ways of celebrating. But there are potential risks to keep in mind, too.\n\nEveryone will likely have a different idea of \"fun,\" so try to find an activity that will be popular across the board. You won't want anyone to be unhappy or refuse to take part. This is a particular risk with physical or outdoor activities that might be difficult for some people, for health, accessibility or confidence reasons.\n\nOnce you've agreed on a suitable event, further questions to answer might be:\n\nWhat's included in the day at the company's expense?\nIs there anyone who'd find it hard to afford the other parts of the day?\nCan people bring family members?\nIf so, will those family members have to pay their own way?\nWhere does that leave colleagues who are single or without children?\n7. Offer extra holiday. Time off can be a great reward, especially when your team has worked extra hours to complete a project. But would working late occasionally for no particular reason also count as an achievement? Be careful about creating false expectations for the future.\n\n8. Set up a hall of fame. An \"employee of the week\" noticeboard or notification can be popular and effective, but it can lose impact over time.\n\nYou risk accusations of tokenism if you feel obliged to choose someone rather than no one, whether they deserve it or not. And if you keep recognizing a \"star\" team member, or constantly overlook another, you might start to alienate people.\n\n9. Have an awards ceremony. A glitzy evening of music, trophies and speeches is an exciting way to combine socializing, team building and networking with formal recognition and celebration.\n\nIf you have the budget, you can hire a venue and a professional events team. However, if you want to limit the expense and increase participation, get your team involved in managing and running the event, including making the food and costumes. This will be fun and rewarding in itself!\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Use your imagination and judgment to create your own celebrations \u2013 and see what happens to productivity and job satisfaction when your people feel celebrated and recognized for their work."}

{"prompt": "Could you extract the poem for the following story? Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[192] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical\u2014written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.[193][194]\n\n\nPity by William Blake, 1795, Tate Britain, is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth:\n\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\"[195]\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[196][197] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[198] By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[199] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[200]\n\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly\u2014\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it\u2014let us know\nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...\n\n\u2014 Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, 4\u20138[200]\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".[201] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[202] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35\u201338); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21\u201325). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[202] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[203]\n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[204] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[205] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[206] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre."}

I just want to know what it says about him getting shot. \"Jackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals.[25] In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records.[26][27] Jackson's first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks,[18] and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album.[12] In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks;[11] eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar.[28] Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.[29][30]\n\nJackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio.[23][31] The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: \"There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant\".[23] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track,[31] and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour.[32] Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.[33]\n\nOn May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.[citation needed] Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek.[12][20][34] His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice;[20][32][35] his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard,[36] was killed three weeks later.[37]\n\nJackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'\"[20] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone\".[15] Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.[12][20][38]\n\nIn the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada.[39][40] With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\"[41] Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\""}

Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.\nAdd the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following text and tell me how the AI will be defined as aligned - Contemporary AI models can be difficult to understand, predict, and control. These problems can lead to significant harms when AI systems are deployed, and might produce truly devastating results if future systems are even more powerful and more widely used, and interact with each other and the world in presently unforeseeable ways.\n\nThis paper shares some nascent work towards one of our primary, ongoing goals, which is to align general-purpose AI systems with human preferences and values. A great deal of ink has been spilled trying to define what it means for AI systems to be aligned, and to guess at how this might go wrong. We will define an AI as \u201caligned\u201d if it is, in three words, helpful, honest, and harmless or \u2018HHH\u2019. Our alignment efforts aim to measure and address this general problem with large language models.\n\nMany researchers and organizations share this goal, but few have pursued it directly. Most research efforts associated with alignment either only pertain to very specialized systems, involve testing a specific alignment technique on a sub-problem, or are rather speculative and theoretical. Our view is that if it\u2019s possible to try to address a problem directly, then one needs a good excuse for not doing so. Historically we had such an excuse: general purpose, highly capable AIs were not available for investigation. But given the broad capabilities of large language models, we think it\u2019s time to tackle alignment directly, and that a research program focused on this goal may have the greatest chance for impact."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the credit reporting agencies?\n\nThree of the country's largest credit reporting agencies are removing nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports, the companies announced in a joint statement Friday.\n\nEquifax (EFX), Experian (EXPGF) and TransUnion (TRU) will eliminate billions of dollars from the accounts of consumers who faced unexpected medical bills that they were unable to pay. The three firms said they made the move after months of research.\n\"Medical collections debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we're taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal well-being,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\nThe announcement follows research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing that Americans had racked up $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records as of June 2021. It's the most common debt collection credit account on credit records, the CFPB said.\nMedical debt can be volatile and unpredictable, and can negatively affect many financially secure consumers. Black, Hispanic, young and low-income consumers are most likely to be impacted by medical debt, the bureau said.\nMedical debt concerns have heightened since the Covid-19 pandemic hospitalized millions of people, and CFBP Director Rohit Chopra has been publicly critical of medical debt collections by credit reporting agencies. On March 1, Chopra said the CFPD will be \"closely scrutinizing\" the Big Three credit reporting agencies.\n\"We expect them to take seriously their role as major actors in the credit reporting system -- a system whose integrity and accuracy can determine the financial futures of hundreds of millions of people,\" Chopra said.\nStarting July 1, paid medical collection debt will no longer be included on consumer credit reports. Millions of Americans had credit scores previously lowered because debts paid after being sent to collections could appear on credit reports for up to seven years.\nMore changes are expected. It will now take one month before unpaid medical collection debt appears on a consumer's report, instead of six months, the previous standard.\nThe three companies also said that starting in the first half of 2023, medical collection debt less than $500 will no longer be included on credit reports."}

{"prompt": "I was wondering why we don't eat turkey eggs. I assume it has to be because they just don't taste good. Is that what this article says? \"According to the National Turkey Federation, the average American ate 16 pounds of turkey in 2012.  On Thanksgiving alone, it\u2019s estimated Americans consume 46 million turkeys.  And even though turkey eggs are edible and similar in taste to chicken eggs, they aren\u2019t as widely consumed. \n\nThe economics of egg production lend a sizable advantage to producing chicken eggs over turkey eggs.  Patty Fuhs of Turkey Downs, a turkey farm in Montgomery, Ind., says most turkey producers use turkey eggs for producing more turkeys rather than selling the eggs.  She says turkeys are more expensive and require more time to produce eggs, consume twice as much feed and lay one-third as many eggs as chickens. \n\nThe average size of a turkey is 16 to 17 pounds compared to 3 to 4 pounds for an average sized chicken.  A chicken lays approximately 300 eggs per year while the average turkey produces only 100 or so.  Not only do turkeys produce fewer eggs but they also require more time to come into egg production.  Chickens come into production at 19 to 20 weeks, while turkeys require 32 weeks. \n\nTurkeys also tend to go broody easily which could hinder a large scale turkey egg operation.  Broodiness occurs when a bird wants to sit on their eggs and incubate them.  Chickens have broodiness bred out of them and otherwise have no desire to incubate their offspring and be maternal.\n\nCulinary factors also contribute to the dearth of turkey egg consumption.  Turkey eggs have a thicker and tougher shell membrane and are harder to break than chicken eggs.  Furthermore, most recipes are designed for the amount of liquid in a chicken egg.  The weight of a large chicken egg is 50 grams, while the weight of a turkey egg is 80 grams. Such a difference could cause dreadful results in ones pumpkin pie.\n\nFred Schnell of Gobble Development in Birdseye, Ind. whose operation produces male turkeys called toms rather than female egg-laying turkey hens says that some people eat what are called mound oysters from the toms.  Mound oysters are turkey testicles -- different type of egg, says Schnell. \n\nThere are health and regulatory concerns with producing turkey eggs as well.  Feed ingredients can be transferred from a turkey hen to an egg and the USDA must clear these ingredients as safe for human consumption.  And while these ingredients have been cleared for chickens, they have not been cleared for turkeys.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentence:\n\nCyprus\u2019 graffiti paints a rich and complex picture of a society divided\nStreet art in Cyprus does more than attract tourists \u2013 it tells the story of the country\u2019s rich, and complicated, history \n\nAll too often, graffiti is categorised as either art or vandalism, when in fact it\u2019s so much more than that. When read with special attention, graffiti can offer deep insights into societies experiencing rapid social and political change \u2013 especially those marred by recent conflict.\n\nThe walls of a city give communities and individuals who may not have a formal platform space to share their feelings and opinions, and challenge dominant beliefs or ideals.\n\nAs researchers interested in societies recovering from disaster or conflict, we recently took a trip to explore graffiti in Cyprus. Cyprus and its capital, Nicosia, have remained divided since 1974, following the Turkish invasion and ensuing conflict.\n\nThe Turkish-Cypriot state in the north (recognised only by Turkey) is separated from the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus in the south by a UN-controlled buffer zone.\n\nCrossings between the two sides are only permitted through closely monitored checkpoints, leaving the Cypriot people physically, politically and culturally divided.\n\nIn places like this, graffiti can both reflect and shape community attitudes at a grassroots level. By seriously examining graffiti as a cultural product of such societies, we can better understand these divisions and work towards peacebuilding.\n\nThe power of graffiti\n\nGraffiti encompasses a wide variety of motivations and styles: anything from tagging to more artistic forms of expression like murals. Research has investigated how graffiti can be a channel for political participation and informal education. It\u2019s a medium widely associated with urban subcultures formed around punk, hip-hop and skateboarding along with many other social movements over the decades.\n\nViews about the value of graffiti can vary just as widely. Authorities, artists and members of the public tend to take different stances, which can also depend on context, content and style. Graffiti has sometimes been linked to social disorder and decline, but it can also add cultural value or in some cases lead to \u201cartwashing\u201d and gentrification. Certainly, it has the power to influence the character of a place, and change urban landscapes over time.\n\nWhen searching for meaning in graffiti, we must look at its form and content. For example, pieces of plain writing may initially seem quite simple, but things like language choices can be telling.\n\nIn Nicosia, Turkish and Greek messages were painted with meaning for each respective \u201cinside\u201d group, while English was used to address a wider, international audience. So language choice is indirectly related to the ethno-nationalist conflict, and acts as an informal commentary on people\u2019s experiences of the city.\n\nInevitably, we saw many references to division and conflict in the graffiti of Nicosia. But we also saw pieces related to local gang tags, local politics, anti-sexism and the patriarchy, racism, migrant worker rights, refugees, consumerism, veganism and LGBT+ inclusion \u2013 among other topics.\n\nThis suggests local people are seeing beyond the past conflict in their daily lives. But it also suggests existing formal platforms for these issues to be addressed may not be effective or leave some feeling disillusioned. So people turn to city walls.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nLarger scale murals across Cyprus are beautifully and skilfully painted \u2013 and equally interesting. In war-torn, damaged urban landscapes, they can be seen as an attempt to make the spaces more aesthetically appealing or to make a larger statement. These are often commissioned, and are even incorporated into official peacebuilding initiatives, art festivals and tourism strategies.\n\nA mural in the southern city of Limassol, depicting a Nepali woman and her child, was painted shortly after the 2015 earthquake; unrelated to the Cypriot conflict itself, it affirms that Cypriot artists are outward-looking and aware of turmoil beyond their own borders (not always common in conflict zones).\n\nSymbols are commonly used in street art across the world to deliver powerful political statements instantly. Internationally recognised symbols make a visual connection to transnational communities, ideologies and movements.\n\nIn Nicosia, common symbols included the Communist hammer and sickle, the Anarchist symbol, the peace sign, doves, gender signs and even swastikas. These symbols have broad, universal meanings attached to them so that no matter where the audience is from (Cyprus receives more than 3m tourists per year), the message is understood.\n\nLocation matters\n\nWhere graffiti is painted also tells a significant story: we saw that location influenced both the amount and the content of graffiti. The old city of Nicosia has lots of buffer zone walls and barriers, and a border crossing on the main shopping thoroughfare.\n\nThe areas closest to crossings contained mostly English language messages, explicitly about the conflict. Further away from the buffer zone, we observed less graffiti, and the messages become more varied.\n\nWe can speculate, then, that the division might have a greater influence on daily life, the closer people are to the dividing wall. This highly contextual insight has the potential to enhance our understanding of the unique experiences of local people in conflict-affected zones.\n\nOur early investigations of graffiti have already told us much about life in conflict-affected Cyprus. Clearly, the importance of graffiti should not be overlooked: it can open a window into the lives and minds of many people, who might otherwise lack a voice."}

They teem with life, with perhaps one-quarter of all ocean species depending on reefs for food and shelter. This is a remarkable statistic when you consider that reefs cover just a tiny fraction (less than one percent) of the earth\u2019s surface and less than two percent of the ocean bottom. Because they are so diverse, coral reefs are often called the rainforests of the sea.\n\nCoral reefs are also very important to people. The value of coral reefs has been estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars and perhaps as much as 172 billion U.S. dollars each year, providing food, protection of shorelines, jobs based on tourism, and even medicines.\n\nUnfortunately, people also pose the greatest threat to coral reefs. Overfishing and destructive fishing, pollution, warming, changing ocean chemistry, and invasive species are all taking a huge toll. In some places, reefs have been entirely destroyed, and in many places reefs today are a pale shadow of what they once were."}

{"prompt": "The Microbus is back, baby! Nearly 75 years since the first Volkswagen Type 2 rolled off its assembly line and into the annals of Americana as an icon of 1960s counterculture, VW is re-releasing the emblematic vehicle \u2014 this time as a full EV.\n\n\nVW executives took to the livestreaming stage on Wednesday ahead of SXSW 2022\u2019s kickoff to debut the ID.Buzz, which will be available as both a people mover and a cargo van (dubbed the ID.Buzz Cargo) beginning this year. The ID.Buzz will appear in Europe first \u2014 arriving later in 2022 \u2014 and will be available with a number of options their American-market cousins will lack, including short-wheelbase and commercial-grade variants. There\u2019s even a Level 4 self-driving version that will begin its Shared Riding Model pilot program in Hamburg in 2025. The American iterations will debut in 2023, Scott Keogh, CEO of VW America promised during the stream, and are slated to arrive in American showrooms in 2024.\n\nVolkswagen only had the European model to show off Wednesday, but Keogh noted that the US version would be \"more stylized for the American marketplace\" but has \"no doubt that it will be worth the wait,\" while teasing a California camper edition. The US version will have a slightly longer wheelbase and offer three rows of seating to the European version's two. With its comparatively shorter wheelbase, the European model's turning radius is a scant 11 meters, on par with the Ioniq 5 or the VW Golf.\n\nThe ID.Buzz is built atop VW\u2019s modular electric drive matrix (MEB if you say it in German), and is actually the largest model to date developed for the platform. MEB is the same base Ford plans to use for one of its European market vehicles in 2023.\n\nThe ID.buzz will come equipped with a 77-kWh battery pack (slightly smaller than the 82kWh pack in the ID.4, which is also MEB-based) with a 170 kw charging capacity powering a 150 kw rear motor. It will be capable of bidirectional charging, at least in the European model, enabling V2H (vehicle-to-home) energy transfers.\n\n\nThe passenger model will seat five with 1.21 cubic meters (39.5 cubic feet) of cargo space while the Cargo will offer 3.9 cubic meters (137.7 cubic feet) by replacing the rear seats with a partition behind the front row. For the interior, VW designers took inspiration from the aesthetics of the Microbus, pulling style elements from the T1 generation of vehicle and matching seat cushions, dash panels and the door trim to the vehicle\u2019s exterior paint color of which buyers will have their pick of seven solid-color options and four two-tone schemes (white + another color).\nCan you summarize this article into 2 bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Does this text give the movie a positive review?\n\nIt\u2019s been almost an entire decade since writer/director Ti West\u2018s last horror feature, The Sacrament. Far too long. Luckily, West ensures that the wait has been worth it with A24\u2019s X, an homage to the gritty indie horror of the \u201970s but with savage style and a deranged sense of humor that\u2019s pure Ti West. A deceptively simple setup gives way to a go-for-broke horror-comedy that leaves you breathless, both from laughter and nail-biting tension.\n\nSet in 1979 Texas, X opens to the aftermath of a bloodbath, to the befuddlement of local officials. Cut to 24 hours earlier, where a group of aspiring adult filmmakers load up in a van and drive from Houston out to the boonies to shoot. Producer Wayne (The Ring\u2019s Martin Henderson) attempts to cut every corner for their limited budget, first by securing a young cinephile to direct, RJ (Owen Campbell), who\u2019s brought girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) to assist and handle the boom mic. Wayne\u2019s enlisted his girlfriend Maxine (Mia Goth), Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and Jackson (Scott Mescudi) to star. Then he\u2019s rented a boarding house on the cheap from the reclusive, elder Howard (Stephen Ure), who warns them to stay out of his wife\u2019s sight.\n\nThe porn production quickly devolves into a fucked up horror picture when things spiral out of control.\n\nTi West's 'X' Highlights Horror Films Premiering at SXSW's 2022 Film Festival!\n\nWest has many surprises in store for X, but the first straight out of the gate is just how wickedly funny it is. From the little details like \u201cPlowing Service\u201d emblazoned across Wayne\u2019s van to the consistent tongue-in-cheek euphemisms befitting of the adult film production, X has a delightfully wicked sense of humor. Snow and Mescudi stand out for their line delivery and comedic timing; their character gags and one-liners land with perfection.\n\nThe second significant shock in store is how fiercely the filmmaker matches the comedy with the horror. While it\u2019s no surprise that West knows how to build tension, he brings it to a whole new level here. West, who co-edits with David Kashevaroff, finds ingenious and innovative ways to create edge-of-your-seat suspense through editing. Spliced scenes don\u2019t just create visual interest; they deliver potent scares. Overhead shots instill unease, a masterclass of terror and foreshadowing with gratifyingly intense payoffs later. West\u2019s intoxicating blend of style and scare-crafting creates a visceral horror experience.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the gore of it all. X is a crowd-pleasing doozy when it comes to brutal bloodletting and kills. Some deaths leave you queasy, and some will leave you cackling with glee. All of it is immensely satisfying.\n\nX is West firing on all cylinders. The commitment to the period is top-level, capturing the aesthetic and vibe without ever coming close to feeling pastiche. It\u2019s all the more impressive considering just how much humor gets injected, which could\u2019ve pushed this into spoof territory quickly in other hands. The editing is a masterclass, a marvel of how West structures this wild tale to maximize the tension or offer reprieve through an onslaught of terror.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cast. The lean, straightforward narrative gets straight to the goods and never wastes time on heavy exposition. It\u2019s all in the little details and the talented cast making these characters feel lived-in with a shared history. We root for this wacky, free-spirited bunch because they\u2019re so charming and genuine. Naturally, it lends well to the horror\u2019s impact.\n\nThe setting and period make for easy comparisons to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and West uses that to lull viewers before pulling the rug out from under them. They share similar DNA and pure grit, but it\u2019s a narratively different beast that demonstrates why West should be given full reign to go full throttle on deranged, savage, and intense horror-comedies more often. It\u2019s a blast.\n\nX releases in theaters on March 18, 2022."}

{"prompt": "Referring the article below, could you summarize it into two sentences?\n\nThe Dreamachine (a contraction of Dream Machine) is a stroboscopic flicker device that produces visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7]"}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize in a few sentences what the text says about dog's senses?\n\nDogs have the same five senses as humans. However, some are more highly developed, and others are deficient compared with those of humans. Dogs\u2019 sense of smell is by far the most acute and is immeasurably better than that of humans. Dogs are used for such tasks as tracking missing persons, digging underground, and tracing toxic substances, such as gases, that are undetectable by humans. Dogs can detect drugs, explosives, and the scents of their masters. Not all canine noses are the same, however. Some breeds, such as the German shepherd and the bloodhound, have much more keenly developed olfactory senses than others. One would not choose a short-nosed breed, such as the pug, to engage in tracking.\n\nEven in short-nosed breeds, however, the olfactory centre is relatively highly developed. It is arranged in folds in order to filter smells from the incoming air. Some rescue dogs are trained to follow a scent on the ground, and others are trained to scent the air. Both are able to distinguish one person from another even after a considerable passage of time. Hunting dogs\u2014such as pointers, retrievers, and spaniels\u2014are trained to scent birds and can distinguish one variety of bird from another.\n\nThe dog\u2019s sense of taste is poorly developed compared with that of humans. If forced to live on their own, dogs will eat almost anything without much discrimination.\n\nDogs possess an acute sense of hearing. Aboriginal breeds had large, erect and very mobile ears that enabled them to hear sounds from a great distance in any direction. Some modern breeds have better hearing than others, but they all can detect noises well beyond the range of the human ear. Dogs are able to register sounds of 35,000 vibrations per second (compared with 20,000 per second in humans), and they also can shut off their inner ear in order to filter out distracting sounds.\n\nThe eyesight of a dog is not as keen as its sense of smell, and it is generally thought that dogs have poor colour perception. Some breeds, such as the Saluki and the Afghan Hound, were developed to chase game by sight over long distances, and these dogs can see well enough to detect any movement far on the horizon. Dogs can generally see better in poor light than humans but not as well in bright light. They have a wider field of vision than humans because their eyes are set further toward the sides of their heads, but they are not as adept at focusing on objects at close range or at judging distances. Dogs have a third eyelid, a membrane that protects the eyeball from irritants and is sometimes visible in front of the eye.\n\nDogs are sensitive to touch, the fifth sense, and use this sense to communicate with one another and with their human counterparts. Learning where to touch a dog is an important part in either stimulating or relaxing it and is useful in training a puppy or bonding with an adult dog."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a TLDR version of this article? \"It was only a week ago that the major powers and institutions that hold the Western alliance together were triumphant in their unity over Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine.\nWhat a difference a full-scale invasion has made.\n\nOn Friday morning, Ukraine\u2019s visibly exasperated President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \u201cThis morning, we are defending our country alone,\u201d following Russia\u2019s ground invasion of the capital, Kyiv.\n\nHe said that while Russia was hit with sanctions by the most powerful countries in the world, \u201cthese are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.\u201d According to his tweets, what Zelensky wants is greater military assistance from his allies, including a no-fly zone, and for sanctions to be tightened on Moscow. One of his chief complaints is that Russia was not cut off from SWIFT after the invasion \u2013 a high-security messaging network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nBased on the escalation in fighting, Zelensky can reasonably claim that the unified Western response has not had the immediate effect of deterring Vladimir Putin and his regime from invading Ukraine.\n\nWhich raises the question of why, in light of a full-scale invasion and after months of preparing for war, has the Western response appeared so underwhelming?\n\nAccording to a senior European Union diplomat, member states were ultimately divided when it came to the crunch on how hard to hit Russia \u2013 especially on the matter of SWIFT. \u201cThere is a group of incrementalists who have been arguing that it should happen step-by-step and that we need to keep something in the tank,\u201d the diplomat said. However, they noted that the holdouts happened to have good economic ties to Russia. They particularly criticized member states who wanted to continue exporting luxury goods to Russia. \u201cIt seems to me the incrementalists are looking for ways of not having to swallow the most difficult pill right away.\u201d\nSo, did the EU simply choke at the last minute? It seems a little more complicated than that. Officials from multiple Western governments told CNN that the sanctions were largely in line with what had been expected and in some cases went further than they\u2019d hoped.\n\nA NATO diplomat explained that the sad reality is, the Ukraine crisis could almost have been tailor-made to reveal the limitations of NATO and the EU when the actors involved are not members of either.\n\u201cPeople in NATO are not angry with the EU or other allies. The reality is there is no Article 5 option. Sanctions, no matter how extreme, can only go so far when you are dealing with someone like Putin,\u201d the NATO diplomat said. One EU official agreed, saying that under normal circumstances, a bloc of 27 nations signing off on the hardest sanctions package would be a cause for celebration.\nThe problem is that most sanctions cannot immediately tank an economy in a way that would stop a war in its tracks. And the situation is just different now that Russia has invaded.\n\nThis is the bind Europe finds itself in at the end of a truly dreadful week. It\u2019s easy to say sanctions should be harder or that military options should be on the table, that an imprecise measure of \u201cmore\u201d should be done.\n\nThe West remains utterly united in the belief that this crisis needs to end as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, big institutions are ultimately limited by the will of their members and the desire for conflict from their opponents.\n\nAnd, for now, it feels that this power dynamic is skewed in Russia\u2019s favor.\""}

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- standing trial in federal court for violating Floyd's civil rights.\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyds death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyd's death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nAll three are each charged with deprivation of rights under color of law as Chauvin restrained Floyd. Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, resulting in Floyd's death. The three have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and are being tried together. Chauvin admitted guilt in December as part of a plea deal.\nAll three former officers will face a state trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder.\nKueng and Thao told US District Judge Paul Magnuson on Monday they planned to testify in their own defense.\nLane, the rookie officer who held down Floyd's legs during the fatal restraint, told the judge Tuesday that he also planned to take the stand. His attorney Earl Gray had told Magnuson a day earlier he wanted to speak with Lane about it before giving a final decision.\nKueng is expected to take the stand after Thao. Assistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell had been pressing Thao on his reasoning for not interfering in Chauvin's handling of Floyd, how often Thao faced toward his fellow officers during the restraint that lead to Floyd's death and whether Thao took any action to assess Floyd's medical condition, including when he was asked to do so by a bystander.\n\"Did you communicate to your partners what you were being told by the bystanders,\" Bell asked.\n\"No,\" Thao replied.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nBell also asked Thao if he knew when Floyd stopped breathing, but defense attorney Robert Paule objected to the question. It was one of a dozen objections during Wednesday morning's cross-examination. Bell seemingly became frustrated at the number of times she had to pause and rephrase her questions due to the number of objections.\n\"Did you hear him talking during the fifth minute or not?\" Bell pressed.\n\"It's a possibility,\" Thao said. When asked if he could confirm if he noticed Floyd's eyes were closed, Thao said he couldn't tell.\nBell continued asking Thao about his knowledge of Floyd's medical condition, of which Paule continued to vehemently object.\""}

Here are our Cinderellas, dark horses, first No. 1s to fall, best first-round bets and Final Four/champion picks.\n\nFrank Schwab: I somehow picked four SEC teams for our \"Yahoo Bracket Now\" show this week, and I might as well stick with it: Kentucky, Arkansas, Auburn and Tennessee, with Auburn and future top-three NBA draft pick Jabari Smith carrying Auburn to the title over Kentucky.\n\nNick Bromberg: It just means more to Frank and I am meeting him halfway. Kentucky and Auburn are making the Final Four and will be joined by Gonzaga and Arizona. The latter two teams win their semifinal games and Gonzaga takes down Arizona in a close national championship game.\n\nSam Cooper: I\u2019ve got Arizona, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas Tech in the Final Four. Kentucky beats Texas Tech and Arizona takes care of Kansas in the Final Four. From there, I\u2019ve got Kentucky taking down Arizona in the title game. I like the way John Calipari has assembled this roster. After so many years of teams that rely on mainly freshmen, he\u2019s got just one in the starting lineup this year, TyTy Washington. Washington and Oscar Tshiebwe get the job done for BBN.\n\nGreg Brainos: Gonzaga, Kentucky, Tennessee and Kansas. In the final, Kansas falls to Kentucky in a battle of Midwest versus fake Midwest, Ashley Judd hires a brass band to march everyone from the Superdome to Bourbon Street, and the night ends with John Calipari and Drake singing karaoke in a dive bar.\n\nPete Truszkowski: Gonzaga, UCLA, Kansas and Tennessee. I think this is the year Gonzaga finally gets it done. UCLA returns a lot of the team that went on that run last year and they had a double-digit lead over Arizona in the second half of the Pac-12 championship game. The Midwest region features a bunch of teams who could be described as frauds such as Providence and Wisconsin, so Kansas has a good path there. As for Tennessee, they might be the hottest team in the country right now.\n\nMark Drumheller: Gonzaga, Kentucky, Houston and Iowa make up my Final Four. Ultimately, Kentucky cuts down the nets. TyTy Washington, Kellan Grady and Oscar Tshiebwe give Kentucky the offensive versatility to score several different ways. That makes all the difference when trying to win six straight games against the best teams in the nation. They stumbled down the stretch, but with it will come together with their point guard healthy."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into TWO SHORT sentences?\n\nEurovision: Russia banned from competing at 2022 Song Contest\n\nRussia will no longer be allowed to participate in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union has said.\n\nThe EBU, which produces the event, said Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\".\n\nRussia launched an attack on its neighbour Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nWestern governments have ramped up international sanctions in response.\n\nCountries' protests\nJust 24 hours ago, the contest had said Russia would be allowed to compete, so this is a rapid change in stance for the EBU.\n\nIt follows the announcement that football's 2022 Champions League final would be played in Paris, after Russia was stripped of the match following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nF1's Russian Grand Prix, due to take place in Sochi in September, was also cancelled.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC urged the EBU to suspend Russia's Eurovision membership and ban it from the contest.\n\nState broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands had called for Russia to be banned from the contest.\n\nFinland said if Russia took part, it would not send a representative to the contest in Turin in May.\n\nThe EBU said it remained dedicated to \"protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage\".\n\nUK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted: \"Eurovision stands for freedom, unity and respect between countries - watched and enjoyed by tens of millions around the world. Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.\"\n\nThe 66th edition of Eurovision is due to take place in Turin, after Italian rock band Maneskin won the 2021 contest.\n\nRussia had not announced its act for the contest, which it last won in 2008 with Dima Bilan singing Believe.\n\nIn recent years, it has been one of the strongest Eurovision performers, with five top five finishes in the past decade.\n\nUkraine has selected hip-hop trio Kalush Orchestra, whose song Stefania was written as a tribute to their mothers.\n\nUkraine urges residents to defend the capital\nBBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more\nUkraine's Eurovision act put on hold by broadcaster\nThe band replaced the country's original contestant, Alina Pash, who withdrew last week after facing scrutiny over a trip she made to Russia-controlled Crimea in 2015.\n\nWhile there is no suggestion Pash entered Crimea from Russia, she said the controversy over her visit had overshadowed her participation in the contest.\n\nThe Ukrainian government considers people who enter the territory via Russia to have crossed the border illegally.\n\nMixed feelings over Ukraine's Eurovision triumph\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine have overshadowed previous editions of the song contest.\n\nRussia were favourites to win the competition in 2016, until Ukrainian singer Jamala stole a last-minute victory with a song that depicted the deportation of Crimean Tatars by Josef Stalin in 1944 - a horrific chapter the nation's parliament has described as tantamount to genocide.\n\nThe lyrics were widely interpreted as a criticism of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor called the result \"a pointed slap in Russia's face\".\n\nA year later, Russian contestant Julia Samoylova was blocked from entering Ukraine, which was hosting the competition, because she had reportedly toured Crimea without entering it through the border with the Ukrainian mainland.\n\nRussian television station Channel One then announced it would not broadcast the contest or take part.\n\nJamala has now called on Eurovision fans not to ignore Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't know how this is possible, but they bombed peaceful people,\" she said in an Instagram video. \"Please support Ukraine.

{"prompt": "A potential new COVID-19 variant, a combination of the delta and omicron variants \u2013 you can call it \"deltacron\" \u2013 has been identified.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Wednesday that the new COVID-19 combination has been detected in France, the Netherlands and Denmark. It's also been found in the U.S., according to a new report soon to be published on research site MedRxiv, and viewed by USA TODAY.\n\nThe San Mateo, California-headquartered lab Helix, which works with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track COVID-19, sequenced 29,719 positive COVID-19 samples collected Nov. 22 to Feb. 13 from across the U.S., according to the research team, which included the University of Washington Medical Center and testing company Thermo Fisher Scientific.\n\nResearchers found two infections involving different versions of deltacron, resulting from the combination of delta and omicron genetic material. Twenty other infections had both the delta and omicron variants, with one case having delta, omicron and Deltacron.\n\nUS COVID-19 map: Tracking cases and deaths\n\nAlcohol and the brain: Just one beer or glass of wine a day may cause your brain to shrink, study suggests\n\nShould we worry about deltacron?\nExperts say it's too soon to worry about deltacron. Compared with earlier variants, such as delta and omicron, this new variation \u2013 researchers have not adopted the \"deltacron\" name officially \u2013 appears unlikely to spread as easily, said William Lee, the chief science officer at Helix.\n\n\"The fact that there is not that much of it, that even the two cases we saw were different, suggests that it's probably not going to elevate to a variant of concern level\" and warrant its own Greek letter name, Lee told USA TODAY.\n\nSo far, in the places where deltacron has been detected, \"there are very low levels of this detection,\" said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an American infectious disease epidemiologist and the WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, during a Wednesday press conference.\n\nFor now, WHO has not seen \"any change in the epidemiology,\" Van Kerkhove said. And regarding deltacron, \"we haven't seen any change in severity. But there are many studies that are underway.\"\n\nWilliam Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, concurs.\n\n\"It's only a variant if it produces a large number of cases,\" he said. \"So no, if it's not causing lots of cases, people don\u2019t need to be concerned.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nHow do we get COVID-19 variants?\nViruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 strain that causes COVID-19 can change and mutate. For instance, the mutations that caused the delta variant resulted in a variant that made people contagious sooner. The omicron variant itself was more contagious and was found to reinfect some who had previously had COVID-19.  Can you summarize this into 2 bullet points please?"}

Kleenex began during the First World War. It developed a crepe paper used as a filter for gas masks. In the early 1920s, it was adapted as a consumer product called Kotex brand to help women with their periods.[1] The Kotex trademark was derived from the combination of the words \"cotton\" and \"texture.\" The company itself has confirmed that this name was chosen as it \"met [their] requirements for being short, easy to say, easy to remember and easy to explain.\" In 1924, the name Kleenex was selected as the name for a line of cold cream remover, as such, the \"Kleen\" portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose. The \"ex\" was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex.[2] The first Western facial tissue was introduced in 1924 and originally marketed as a way to remove cold cream (it had already been in use in Japan for centuries; see History of facial tissue for details).[3] It was a disposable substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing \"the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars.\" A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan \"Don\u2019t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket\" and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant.[4] In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.[5]"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 facts about avalanches based on the text below?\n\nAvalanches are most common during the winter, December to April in the Northern Hemisphere, but they do occur year-round.\n\nTo get an avalanche, you need a surface bed of snow, a weaker layer that can collapse, and an overlaying snow slab. The highest risk period is during and immediately after a snow storm. Underlying snowpack, overloaded by a quick deluge of snow, can cause a weak layer beneath the slab to fracture naturally.\n\nHuman-triggered avalanches start when somebody walks or rides over a slab with an underlying weak layer. The weak layer collapses, causing the overlaying mass of snow to fracture and start to slide. Earthquakes can also trigger strong avalanches.\n\nBy digging a snow pit or profile, scientists can look at the composition of different snow layers that formed during a season, sort of like looking at the layers of a cake. The size and shape of the snowflakes in each layer provide clues about the weather events that occurred: big dumps of snow, drought, rain, a hard freeze, or loose, powdery snow. Larger, looser snow crystals are weaker, because there are fewer points they can touch to interact with the other snow layers. The interaction of the snow layers can help predict the chances of an avalanche.\n\n\u201cSnow is an incredibly dynamic and complicated medium, which means avalanches are the same,\u201d says Trautman. He emphasizes that conditions can change rapidly with the weather, and this can be deadly.\n\nSlopes shaded from direct sun stay cooler, preventing bonding between snow layers and leading to more avalanches in cold conditions. Conversely, during the spring, sunny mountainsides have a higher risk for avalanches because of rapid warming and melting. The number of \u201cwet snow\u201d slides could increase in the future with climate change, experts warn.\n\nPrecipitation type and intensity, temperature, wind, slope steepness and orientation (the direction it faces), terrain, vegetation, and general snowpack conditions can influence whether and how snow moves down a slope. Moving across the terrain, slight changes in slope or how the mountainside is oriented towards the sun can create drastically different conditions."}

It\u2019s about how ideas spread. In the book, I go on and on about how free ideas spread faster than expensive ones. That\u2019s why radio is so important in making music sell.\n\nAnyway, I brought it to my publisher and said, \u201cI\u2019d like you to publish this, but I want to give it away on the net.\u201d They passed. They used to think I was crazy, but now they were sure of it. So I decided to just give it away. The first few days, the book was downloaded 3,000 times (note: forgive the layout. It\u2019s not what I would do if I was doing it today). The next day, the number went up. And then up. Soon it was 100,000 and then a million. The best part of all is that I intentionally made the file small enough to email. Even without counting the folks who emailed it hundreds of times to co-workers, it\u2019s easily on more than 2,000,000 computers. I didn\u2019t ask anything in return. No centralized email tool. Here it is. Share it.\n\nA Google search finds more than 200,000 matches for the word \u2018ideavirus\u2019, which I made up. Some will ask, \u201chow much money did you make?\u201d And I think a better question is, \u201chow much did it cost you?\u201d How much did it cost you to write the most popular ebook ever and to reach those millions of people and to do a promotion that drove an expensive hardcover to #5 on Amazon and #4 in Japan and led to translation deals in dozens of countries and plenty of speaking gigs?\n\nIt cost nothing.\n\nChangethis, which I dreamed up in a moment of weakness a few years ago, is still going strong under better management now. It\u2019s the epicenter of ebook distribution, but there are plenty of places just dying to host your content. And your blog is the best place to launch your idea. The biggest challenge is that there are no barriers. If you want to do it, go do it. Ideas worth spreading, spread."}

It\u2019s in the Stars\n\nLONDON \u2014 The three-story mural showing a workman chipping away at one of the 12 stars of the European Union flag appeared mysteriously in Dover, England, over the weekend, at once banal and symbolically poignant.\n\nBefore the paint had dried, social media was swirling with the well-trodden guessing game as to whether the intricate stenciled imagery belonged to Banksy, the enigmatic and anonymous guerrilla street artist whose work has graced walls from Britain to the West Bank.\n\nThe mystery was solved when Banksy posted photographs of the work on his official Instagram feed on Sunday, perhaps timed to coincide with the French presidential vote \u2014 which, as it turned out, the young and ardently pro-European Union former investment banker Emmanuel Macron won decisively.\n\nThe election solidified France\u2019s place at the center of the European Union and highlighted Britain\u2019s position on the outside looking in.\n\nThe timing and location of the installation infused it with added resonance. Britons will vote next month in a general election that Prime Minister Theresa May has justified on the grounds that it will buttress her position in tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey ought to make it the Brexit logo,\u201d a resident of Dover, where a majority voted to leave the bloc, told the website kentnews.co.uk. (The stars in the circle are intended to symbolize unity and do not refer to the number of member states.)\n\nOthers were less impressed. \u201cIs it really Banksy?\u201d Jan Honza Zicha wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember time when he was \u2018on to subject\u2019 before anyone else or at least part of the first liners. Unfortunately this time, he is about 10 months too late and the art work is truly ... well obvious and uninnovative.\u201d\n\nMalcolm John Haines wrote on Facebook, \u201cAnother boring piece of \u2018art\u2019 from the left wing\u2019s favourite millionaire luvvie.\u201d\n\nBut Mel Lloyd, an ecologist, lauded the strategic placement of the mural, on a building next to the A20, a main road not far from the Dover ferry terminal, one of the country\u2019s main gateways to Europe. \u201cHuge, fabulous, strategically placed new Banksyesque graffiti in Dover on A20,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTraffic leaving Dover Port will see this.\u201d\n\nBanksy, whose zealous guarding of his identity helps maintain interest in his work, is no stranger to political art.\n\nIn 2015, he created several artworks at a ramshackle migrant camp in Calais, France, known as the Jungle, where thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere lived while trying to find a way to reach Britain. One work showed the Apple founder Steve Jobs, an apparent reminder that Mr. Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBanksy attracted praise and ridicule two years ago after he unveiled a satirical exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England. The exhibition featured, among other things, mock security guards instructed to frown; a work showing a woman on a park bench being attacked by sea gulls; and a wreck of Cinderella\u2019s carriage, complete with Cinderella dangling lifelessly out of the carriage while surrounded by paparazzi, an image seemingly calculated to recall the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMore recently, the artist opened the Walled Off Hotel near the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank, offering rooms as well as what the hotel claims is the \u201cworst view in the world.\u201d The project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about Google's new ability?\n\nGoogle is finally releasing a \"delete history\" feature, which will wipe out the last 15 minutes of search queries, for the Android Google Search app. \"Delete history\" was announced at Google I/O 2021 in May and made it to the iOS app two months later, but for some reason, it took almost a year to come to Android. It's finally rolling out now, though, according to a statement Google gave to The Verge over the weekend.\n\nIf you want to wipe out the last few minutes of your search history, open the Google Search app via the app icon (other entry points, like the search bar widget, won't bring up the right UI), tap on your profile picture in the top right and you should see a new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option at the top of the pop-up menu. If you don't see the setting yet, try swiping the app away in recent apps and opening it again, which will load the newest configuration from the cloud.\n\nWiping out your search history is sort of like wiping out browser history, but Google stores search history to your account in the cloud. As the app explains, Google Search history tracks \"the things you search for, results you click, and stories you read\" while using the Google app or Google.com. Google also captures your location, plus audio recordings if you run a voice search. The search terms are used to show more relevant ads, of course, but also for future search predictions and to display content in Google Discover.\n\nThe control for search history is under the \"Web & App Activity\" feature. In the app, you can control this setting by tapping on the \"search history\" button just above the new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option, or you can head to myactivity.google.com in a browser. Web & App Activity can be turned off completely, or you can set the system to \"auto-delete\" your data older than three, 18, or 36 months."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nWho Is Julia Kristeva?\n\nJulia Kristeva is a name that often gets bounced around in conversations about contemporary theory and philosophy. But who, exactly, is Kristeva, and why is she so important? Born in Bulgaria in 1941, she moved to France at the age of 23, and here she became a leader in philosophy, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Her writing has encompassed various subjects including sociology, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and art history. She has also published more than 30 books and leading scholarly essays, and been awarded a series of prestigious prizes including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize. Let\u2019s take a look at her life and work in more detail.\n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leader In Semiotics\n\nThroughout her career, Kristeva has pursued the subject of semiotics, or the study of signs, symbols and language. She trained in linguistics at the University of Sofia, before moving to France in the 1960s. In France, Kristeva became a member of the Tel Quel group, a band of French academics who published the literary journal Tel Quel. The journal gave Kristeva a platform to explore ideas around the politics of language. \n\nTwo of Her Most Important Early Publications Explored Semiotics\n\nKristeva\u2019s early work with Tel Quel became the foundation for her first two publications, Semeiotik\u00e8 (1969) and La R\u00e9volution du langage po\u00e9tique (The Revolution of Poetic Language) (1974). These texts drew on Freudian, Lacanian, and Kleinian psychoanalysis, examining how language, culture and ideologies are built out of unconscious body and gender-based dimensions. Further training in psychoanalysis in the 1970s deepened Kristeva\u2019s belief that unconscious emotions and feelings are intertwined with the meaning invested into our forms of communication.\n\n \n\nAfter the Birth of Her Son, Julia Kristeva Became Increasingly Interested In Child Psychology\n\nFollowing the birth of her son in the 1970s, Kristeva began exploring the semiotic link between mother and child. Her iconic text of this period was Pouvoirs de l\u2019horreur (Powers of Horror) (1980/1982), which explored the power struggle between mother and child as the child eventually rejects their mother in order to find themselves. She calls this rejection of the mother \u201cabjection\u201d, and she believed her notion of the abject would come to replay throughout the human\u2019s adult life in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nKristeva Wrote About the Role of Abjection In Adulthood\n\nSome of Kristeva\u2019s most graphic and disturbing writing explains how we experience the \u201cabject\u201d as adults. She outlines the kinds of horrible, unappealing objects, smells or experiences we naturally reject, such as milk-skin, fingernail clippings, dead bodies, human waste and so on... Not the most enjoyable read. But it does give us a fascinating insight into the workings of the human mind, and the way we respond to external stimuli outside our own body. \n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leading Feminist\n\nAmong her many achievements, Kristeva has been recognized as a leader in feminist theory. She has written extensively about women\u2019s bodies, particularly in relation to motherhood, and the role they play as a primal source of rhythm, tone and movement for every human being before it comes into the real world. One of her most important feminist essays is Women\u2019s Time (1979). In this work she argues there are three types of feminism. The first, which seeks universal equality, overlooking any sexual differences. The second phase emphasizes a uniquely feminine language, which she ultimately disregards as impossible, because she believes gender is too diverse to easily categorize. The third phase of Kristeva\u2019s feminism explores multiple identities, suggesting there are as many different kinds of sexualities are there are people. It\u2019s a fascinating theory that is particularly relevant for today\u2019s culture, which has opened up many debates about the complexities of gender, sexuality and identity."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following source material and tell me who was the president at the time of the event, what category was the event, where the event affected the worse - Hurricane Katrina was a large and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that caused over 1,800 fatalities and $125 billion in damage in late August 2005, especially in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. It was at the time the costliest tropical cyclone on record and is now tied with 2017's Hurricane Harvey. The storm was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States.\n\nKatrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida, strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nFlooding, caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system (levees)[3] around the city of New Orleans, precipitated most of the loss of lives.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes, were inundated for weeks.[5] The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food, shelter, or other basic necessities. The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts; federal, local, and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks. Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems,[6] though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7]\n\nThe emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Eddie Compass. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and President George W. Bush, while several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC was especially applauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.[8] Katrina was the earliest 11th named storm on record before being surpassed by Tropical Storm Kyle on August 14, 2020.[9]"}

{"prompt": "A new legal opinion from the Biden administration appears to clear the way for wider use of an underutilized harm reduction technique: paying people addicted to drugs for staying clean.\n\nKnown as \"contingency management,\" the idea is supported by decades of research that shows providing repeated small payments for meeting goals in the recovery process has an outsize impact in helping people remain sober. The technique also has been used to help people quit smoking, lose weight and change other unwanted behaviors.\n\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\n\nBut until last week when the inspector general's office for the Department of Health and Human Services posted an advisory legal opinion, its use was sharply limited by concern that any such program would run afoul of a federal law that bars kickbacks to patients. At the request of a company that has been using the method and conducting research on the effectiveness of payments to drug users, people addicted to alcohol and smokers, the government for the first time allayed those fears.\n\nIn the nine-page opinion, Robert DeConti, an HHS assistant inspector general for legal affairs, said Boston-based DynamiCare Health would not face criminal or civil penalties for its payment plan.\n\nVideo: An intimate look at addiction in Washington, D.C.\nScroll back up to restore default view.\n\"Although the arrangement would generate prohibited remuneration under the federal anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent were present, the OIG [Office of Inspector General] will not impose administrative sanctions on requestor in connection with the arrangement,\" DeConti wrote.\n\nThe ruling allows the company to pay clients as much as $599, a sharp increase from the $75 limit the government had previously observed, which many experts considered too low to be effective. DynamiCare chose $599 because it is the most a client can receive without having to pay taxes on the money.\n\nThe opinion and an HHS spokeswoman emphasized that the decision applies only to DynamiCare. Others who want to offer similar inducements would have to receive their own advisory from the OIG. But DynamiCare co-founder David Gastfriend and others who have tried to persuade HHS to allow higher-paying contingency management programs said they expected many others would move quickly to provide the therapy.\n\n\"This is a breakthrough,\" Gastfriend said.\n\nThe Biden administration made eliminating barriers to contingency management a priority when it announced it was embracing harm reduction in April. The administration was embroiled in a minor controversy last month after conservatives launched an online furor erroneously claiming that the government would spend $30 million on pipes for smoking crack cocaine.\n\nContingency management is considered especially valuable for treatment of people addicted to stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine because there are no proven medications for that disorder. Opioid abuse is best treated with medications such as buprenorphine and methadone, though far too few people receive them.\n\nDeaths from stimulants are climbing along with the better-known rise in opioid-induced fatalities. In 2020, the overdose death rate from stimulants such as methamphetamine was up 50% over 2019 and the cocaine overdose death rate rose 22%, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nUnder a waiver from HHS, California is set to launch a $58.5 million test of contingency management for people with stimulant use disorder in July, using Medicaid funds. So far, 27 counties are enrolled in two phases, a participation rate that should yield thousands of clients, said Kelly Pfeifer, deputy director for behavioral health at the California Department of Health Care Services.\n\nUnder the plan, participants would agree to in-person urine tests twice a week for 24 weeks, and receive escalating rewards for each clean test. The payments would start at $10 and escalate to $26.50 in the 12th week, before declining for the second half of the program, and jumping to $21 per test in the final week.\n\nEvidence of drug use in the test would reset the program but clients could receive only $599, Pfeifer said.\n\nThe money would be put on a gift card, with protections built into the program to prevent spending on alcohol, cigarettes, vaping material, marijuana and gambling, she said. But Pfeifer acknowledged that \"no program we will set up will be 100% protected against misuse.\"\n\nAsked why taxpayer dollars should go to people who use illegal drugs, Pfeifer said: \"The data is robust, unequivocal. There's nothing else that works to move people toward recovery.\"\n\nKeith Humphreys, a psychiatry professor and drug policy researcher at Stanford University, said contingency management works because of its emphasis on immediate rewards. People with substance use disorders have even less ability to delay gratification than those who are not in the grip of drugs, he said.\n\n\"You're interested in what's going to happen right now, not what's going to happen in a week or a year,\" Humphreys said. \"You can't think that far ahead, about a larger, later award.\"\n\nPfeifer said the incentives can \"change the reward balance in the brain\" that has been altered by long-term drug use.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has experience with such programs at its hospitals, where it has offered discounts at canteens and other rewards for accomplishing steps toward recovery, Humphreys said.\n\nAn ongoing concern is how clients will fare once the incentives have run out. Coaching and other forms of therapy may well be needed.   Can you summarize this into two concise bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "My friend says that this article says AI is racist. Is that really what it says? \"Proponents of expanding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) often point to its potential to stimulate economic growth \u2014 increased productivity at lower costs, a higher GDP per capita, and job creation have all been touted as possible benefits. The promise of an economic boost via machine learning is understandably seductive, and private and government actors are now regularly using AI in key areas of economic opportunity, including education, housing, employment, and credit, to name just a few. But as AI adoption is cast as a smart economic investment in the future, it\u2019s important to pause and ask: Whose futures and whose wallets are we talking about?\n\nThere is ample evidence of the discriminatory harm that AI tools can cause to already marginalized groups. After all, AI is built by humans and deployed in systems and institutions that have been marked by entrenched discrimination \u2014 from the criminal legal system, to housing, to the workplace, to our financial systems. Bias is often baked into the outcomes the AI is asked to predict. Likewise, bias is in the data used to train the AI \u2014 data that is often discriminatory or unrepresentative for people of color, women, or other marginalized groups \u2014 and can rear its head throughout the AI\u2019s design, development, implementation, and use. The tech industry\u2019s lack of representation of people who understand and can work to address the potential harms of these technologies only exacerbates this problem.\n\nThere are numerous examples of the harms that AI can have. AI tools have perpetuated housing discrimination, such as in tenant selection and mortgage qualifications, as well as hiring and financial lending discrimination.\n\nDonate to protect our civil liberties\nFor example, AI systems used to evaluate potential tenants rely on court records and other datasets that have their own built-in biases that reflect systemic racism, sexism, and ableism, and are notoriously full of errors. People are regularly denied housing, despite their ability to pay rent, because tenant screening algorithms deem them ineligible or unworthy.\n\nThese algorithms use data such as eviction and criminal histories, which reflect long standing racial disparities in housing and the criminal legal system that are discriminatory towards marginalized communities. People of color seeking loans to purchase homes or refinance have been overcharged by millions thanks to AI tools used by lenders. And many employers now use AI-driven tools to interview and screen job seekers, many of which pose enormous risks for discrimination against people with disabilities and other protected groups. Rather than help eliminate discriminatory practices, AI has worsened them \u2014 hampering the economic security of marginalized groups that have long dealt with systemic discrimination.\n\nThat\u2019s why today, the ACLU, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Upturn, and two dozen partner organizations are calling on the Biden administration to take concrete steps to bring civil rights and equity to the forefront of its AI and technology policies, and to actively work to address the systemic harms of these technologies. Just two weeks ago, many of the same groups also joined together in an in-depth response to a request for information by federal financial agencies on the use of AI, raising many of the same concerns. Many groups have also offered concrete policy recommendations to federal agencies on addressing technology\u2019s role in discrimination in the domains of hiring, housing, and financial services.\n\nThus far, federal agencies that regulate industries using AI have not taken the steps necessary to ensure that AI systems are accountable to the people they impact or that they comply with civil rights laws. Federal legislative and regulatory efforts have not yet methodically undertaken the task of ensuring our civil rights laws protect vulnerable people from the harms exacerbated by today\u2019s technologies. In fact, while the Biden administration has made an overarching commitment to center racial equity throughout federal policymaking, the administration\u2019s emerging AI and technology priorities have lacked the necessary focus on equity for people of color and others who have been subject to discrimination and bias. The administration to date has overlooked necessary civil rights and civil liberties perspectives as AI and technology policies are being developed, which risks further perpetuating systemic racism and economic inequality.\n\nThe bottom line is that the administration and federal agencies must prioritize and address all the ways that AI and technology can exacerbate racial and other inequities and ensure that its policies and enforcement activities lead to more equitable outcomes. Decades of discrimination have left people of color and Black people in particular, women, and other marginalized groups at an economic disadvantage in the U.S. The Biden administration must work to reverse the trends that continue to this day, which must necessarily include an emphasis on how modern digital technologies perpetuate inequity. The economic and racial divide in our country will only deepen if the administration fails to do so.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nKae Tempest says trans people are \u2018obsessed over by people void of humanity\u2019\n\nPoet and playwright said \u2018I don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war\u2019\n\nKae Tempest has opened up about their decision to come out as non-binary in the summer of 2020.\n\nSpeaking at length for the first time about the subject, the hip-hop poet and playwright \u2013 formerly known as Kate Tempest \u2013 said that \u201ccoming out has been huge\u201d.\n\nIn August 2020, in a Twitter post, Tempest announced their name is now Kae and explained that, going forward, they would be using they/them pronouns.\n\n\u201cI have tried,\u201d they wrote at the time, \u201cto be what I thought others wanted me to be so as not to risk rejection. This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. They also won the Ted Hughes Award for their play Brand New Ancients in 2013."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this information on a charities project: Agriculture\nMarket-oriented agricultural development\nA number of Mercy Corps' agriculture-related programs are jointly delivered with objectives in other areas such as water conservation, disaster resilience, emergency crisis response and market system development. For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]"}

{"prompt": "Can you tell me the important information from this text?\n\nCoral reefs are the most diverse of all marine ecosystems. They teem with life, with perhaps one-quarter of all ocean species depending on reefs for food and shelter. This is a remarkable statistic when you consider that reefs cover just a tiny fraction (less than one percent) of the earth\u2019s surface and less than two percent of the ocean bottom. Because they are so diverse, coral reefs are often called the rainforests of the sea.\n\nCoral reefs are also very important to people. The value of coral reefs has been estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars and perhaps as much as 172 billion U.S. dollars each year, providing food, protection of shorelines, jobs based on tourism, and even medicines.\n\nUnfortunately, people also pose the greatest threat to coral reefs. Overfishing and destructive fishing, pollution, warming, changing ocean chemistry, and invasive species are all taking a huge toll. In some places, reefs have been entirely destroyed, and in many places reefs today are a pale shadow of what they once were."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article please: The iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, or \u201cT. Rex,\u201d might need to be re-categorized into three distinct species, according to researchers. \n\nThe Tyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus to date \u2013 though previous research has reportedly acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurs skeletal remains. \n\nIn a controversial new study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Evolutionary Biology, South Carolina and Maryland paleontologists conducted an analysis of skeletal remains they said reveal physical differences in the femur and other bones and dental structures.\n\nBased on a dataset of 37 specimens, the group looked at the robustness in the femur of 24 specimens and measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender teeth resembling incisors. \nAccording to an accompanying release, the scientists observed that the femur varied across specimens, with two times more robust femurs than svelte ones across specimens. Robust femurs were also found in some juvenile specimens and \u201cgracile\u201d femurs were found in some that were full adult size, suggesting that variation is not related to growth. \n\nDental structure also varied and those with one incisorform tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.They explained the Tyrannosaurus specimens \u201cexhibit such a remarkable degree of proportional variations, distributed at different stratigraphic levels, that the pattern favors multiple species at least partly separated by time; ontogenetic and sexual causes being less consistent with the data.\u201d\n\n\u201cVariation in dentary incisiform counts correlate with skeletal robusticity and also appear to change over time,\u201d the authors noted. \n\n28 specimens could be identified in distinct layers of sediment at the Lancian upper Maastrichtian formations in North America \u2013 which was estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago \u2013 and the paleontologists compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.Only robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment \u2013 and variation was not different to that of other theropod species \u2013 which the release said indicates that just one species of Tyrannosaurus likely existed at this point. \n\nHowever, the variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher, suggesting the specimens had physically developed into more distinct forms and other dinosaur species. \n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAbout 2.5 billion T. Rex roamed Earth but not at once\n\u201cWe found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen,\u201d lead author Gregory Paul said in a statement. \u201cWe propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.\u201d\n\nBased on that evidence, the researchers said three morphotypes \u2013 what Science Direct defines as any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population \u2013 and two additional species of Tyrannosaurus were \u201cdiagnosed\u201d and named. \n\n\u201cOne robust species with two small incisors in each dentary appears to have been present initially, followed by two contemporaneous species (one robust and another gracile) both of which had one small incisor in each dentary, suggesting both anagenesis and cladogenesis occurred,\u201d they continued. \n\nEvolution can take place by anagenesis, in which changes occur within a lineage. Whereas, in cladogenesis, a lineage splits into two or more separate lines.\n\nThe authors nominated two potential species: \u201cTyrannosaurus imperator\u201d and \u201cTyrannosaurus regina.\u201d\n\nTyrannosaurus imperator relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth.\n\nTyrannosaurus regina is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The Tyrannosaurus rex was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment, with more robust femurs and only one incisor tooth. \n\nThe authors acknowledged that they cannot rule out that variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups. They also cautioned that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. \n\nReaction to the study from scientists has been largely skeptical, with some claiming the paper does not have enough evidence to reach its conclusions \u2013 and raising concerns over some of the specimens included in the study to National Geographic.\n\nPaul told The New York Times on Feb. 28 that he knows his proposal is provocative. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that there could be a lot of people who aren\u2019t going to be happy about this,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cAnd, my response to them is: Publish a refutation.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "From these paragraphs, can you tell me what Marx's view of Industrial Capitalism is?\n\nHistorical materialism\nAccording to Marx\u2019s materialist theory, history is a series of class struggles and revolutionary upheavals, leading ultimately to freedom for all. Marx derived his views in part from the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel, who conceived of history as the dialectical self-development of\u201cspirit.\u201d In contrast to Hegel\u2019s philosophical idealism, however, Marx held that history is driven by the material or economic conditions that prevail in a given age. \u201cBefore men can doanything else,\u201d Marx wrote, \u201cthey must first produce the means of their subsistence.\u201d Without material production there would be no life and thus no human activity.\nAccording to Marx, material production requires two things: \u201cmaterial forces of production\u201d\u2014roughly, raw materials and the tools required to extract and process them\u2014and \u201csocialrelations of production\u201d\u2014the division of labour through which raw materials are extracted and processed. Human history is the story of both elements\u2019 changing and becoming ever more complex. In primitive societies, the material forces were few and simple\u2014for example, grains and the stone tools used to grind them into flour. With the growth of knowledge and technology came successive upheavals, or \u201crevolutions,\u201d in the forces and relations of production and in the complexity of both. For example, iron miners once worked with pickaxes and shovels, which they owned, but the invention of the steam shovel changed the way they extracted iron ore. Since no miner could afford to buy a steam shovel, he had to work for someone who could. Industrial capitalism, in Marx\u2019s view, is an economic system in which one class\u2014the ruling bourgeoisie\n\u2014owns the means of production while the working class or proletariat effectively loses its independence, the worker becoming part of the means of production, a mere \u201cappendage of the machine.\u201d"}

Jes McBride joined our staff in 2020 and, as a former urban planner, was similarly blown away that YIMBYs were not just showing up in droves to (boring) public meetings, you were actually giving us funding to be there!\n\n2022 is going to be our most ambitious year yet, so we hope to continue partnering with you!

{"prompt": "What does this text say about the new Samsung OLED TV?\n\nSamsung announced the pre-order availability of several flagship TV models shown at CES 2022 earlier this year, but buried at the bottom of its press release were three words that immediately caught my attention: Samsung OLED TV.\n\nThe writeup was rather vague, but after some back and forth, the company confirmed that the Samsung OLED TV (S95B) uses the hugely anticipated QD-OLED screen technology. The naming will likely cause confusion but the idea seems to be that OLED is already a household name, and now Samsung wants people to associate it with its brand, not the Korean rival who has dominated the OLED TV space in recent years.\n\nQD-OLED combines the best of Quantum Dot with the best of OLED to create infinite contrast ratios, perfect black levels, and high brightness levels. You can learn more about the technology in our QD-OLED guide but the short version is that quantum dots sit on a separate layer in front of an OLED one and emit blue light to illuminate pixels that contain red and green quantum dots. Each pixel is essentially converted into three subpixels, covering red, green, and blue, which can be combined to create true white light.\n\nThough it breaks new ground for Samsung, the Samsung OLED TV isn\u2019t the first device with QD-OLED tech. Sony unveiled at CES 2022 its Bravia A95K which also uses QD-OLED and Alienware released a monitor with the same panel tech. It is rather unusual for Samsung to be so coy about what could be one of its most important releases of the year. Whatever the case for that, this is big news for the TV industry.\n\nNow, back to the TV itself. Samsung OLED uses the same Neural Quantum Processor found in the Neo 8K for optimizing upscaled images. It runs on Tizen, an easy-to-navigate proprietary TV OS found on most Samsung sets. The company is also touting the OLED TV\u2019s sound quality, which supports Object Tracking Sound and Dolby Atmos for a surround sound effect and Q-Sympathy for playing audio through your TV and soundbar simultaneously.\n\nOf note is an \u201cOLED brightness booster.\u201d Samsung didn\u2019t provide brightness ratings, but this feature sounds encouraging. One downside of OLED panels is that they don\u2019t get as bright as backlit panels\u2013a flaw QD-OLED should resolve. The new hybrid technology isn\u2019t the only thing that could make you consider upgrading your current TV as the Samsung OLED also supports HDR10+ and has a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nAs for the design, Samsung is calling it \u201cLaserSlim\u201d because it is as thin as a laser beam...I guess? Anyway, the TV does look extremely thin (1.6 inches without the stand) based on the photos Samsung provided. On the rear are four HDMI ports all of which support 4K at 120Hz, which could make this a good option for gaming.\n\nThe Samsung OLED S95B is available for pre-order today in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, with prices set at $2,399 and $3,499, respectively. Sony\u2019s versions come in the same sizes but pricing has yet to be released."}

{"prompt": "Below is the text taken from a recent news article. Can you summarize the important points from it into a list for me?\n\nSouth Korea reported 102,211 coronavirus cases on Saturday, topping the 100,000 mark for a second-straight day, though down slightly from the record level reported on Friday.\nInfections have spiked as the Omicron variant ravages the country. Cases have now doubled since South Korea first surpassed 50,000 infections on February 10.\nDespite the increase in cases authorities said that social distancing measures would be only slightly eased ahead of the March 9 presidential election.\n\nAuthorities announced on Friday they would move a curfew on restaurants and cafes from 9pm to 10pm, a nod to increasing criticism from business owners.\nOther anti-pandemic rules such as a six-person cap on private gatherings, a seven-day quarantine for international arrivals, mask mandates in public spaces, and vaccine passes for a range of businesses, will be in place until at least March 13, officials said, after the election.\nMalaysian study finds ivermectin doesn\u2019t help Covid-19 patients\nMalaysian researchers have found that treatment with the anti-parasite drug ivermectin did not prevent patients with Covid-19 from becoming severely ill in a randomised clinical trial published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal on Friday.\nThe researchers said their findings do not support the use of ivermectin for patients with Covid-19.\n\nThe study enrolled 490 patients with mild to moderate illness at 20 hospitals and a Covid-19 quarantine centre in Malaysia. Everyone received standard care; half the group also received ivermectin.\n\nSevere disease developed in 21.6 per cent of the patients given ivermectin and in 17.3 per cent of those who received only standard care, the researchers said. They defined severe disease as requiring oxygen to help with breathing.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between the groups in rates of ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death, according to the study.\n\nNew Zealand registers 1,900 daily cases\nNew Zealand\u2019s Omicron surge continued on Saturday as the country registered 1,901 new Covid-19 infections, with 1,240 of the cases in the largest city of Auckland.\nIt marks the second straight day New Zealand has topped 1,900 infections, but the figure is down from Friday\u2019s record of 1,929 community cases.\nNational numbers in the Omicron outbreak have almost doubled since Wednesday, when 1,160 community cases were registered.\nAs the Omicron outbreak continues to grow in scale, Aucklanders are being warned they could wait up to five days to get their Covid test results back.\nThe news has sparked concern over how long people will need to isolate even if they don\u2019t have the virus.\n\n\u201cThere is still high demand at community testing centres in Auckland as case numbers rise, and we do understand some people are anxious at this time,\u201d Matt Hannant, director of operations at the Northern Region Health Coordination Centre, said.\n\u201cHowever, this is putting significant pressure on laboratories and means that while some results are being returned within 48 hours, an increasing number are taking up to five days.\nThat means people could be isolating at home for up to five days even if they return a negative result.\nThe Ministry of Health has echoed the request for Aucklanders not to call Healthline for results as the service is not able to provide that information.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to experience high demand at Covid-19 testing sites, including from asymptomatic people who are seeking tests for their own reassurance,\u201d the ministry said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that you only get tested if you have cold or flu symptoms, have been identified as a close contact of a case, or have been asked to get tested by a health official.\n\u201cUnnecessary testing is resulting in long waits at testing centres and could also delay results for those who urgently need them.\u201d\nThailand records highest infection total since August\nThailand reported 18,885 new infections on Saturday, its highest daily tally since August 22 last year.\nThis marks the second straight day cases have exceeded 18,000 across the country, after 18,066 new infections were registered on Friday.\nThailand has averaged more than 16,000 new infections over the past week, mostly due to the Omicron variant."}

{"prompt": "Can you tell me about the Primate Forest that the zoo is creating?\n\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has revealed details of the \"major announcement\" they had been teasing as it will create the Primate Forest, a 140,000-square-foot indoor destination that will serve as the new home for the park's gorillas and orangutans. It will also \"transform and significantly expand\" the zoo's existing RainForest attraction.\n\nThe Primate Forest will be a \"multi-year, multi-phased project\" that zoo officials hope to begin construction on as early as next year. The total cost has not yet been determined as construction plans continue to be finalized. The Cleveland Zoological Society is actively fundraising for the project, which is expected to be funded primarily by philanthropic donations.  \n\nZoo officials say the initial expansion will be centered around the two-story CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery, a new entranceway to the Primate Forest \"that will immerse guests in the wonders of the natural world through interactive technology, multi-story play structures and more.\"\n\n\u201cThe partnership with CrossCountry Mortgage is catalytic to bringing a truly transformative experience to Cleveland,\u201d said Cleveland Metroparks CEO Brian M. Zimmerman in a statement. \u201cThe new CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery and yet to be named Primate Forest habitats will connect our guests with wildlife like never before.\u201d\n\nThe Primate Forest will also add two new expansive, multi-story habitats for gorillas and orangutans. This comes after Cleveland Metroparks Zoo celebrated the birth last year of both a baby gorilla and baby orangutan, two of the world\u2019s most endangered primates. The Primate Forest will also incorporate the more than 10,000 plants and more than 600 animals that currently live in the rainforest through additional enhancements."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following and provide a synopsis of helpful, honest and harmless - What are Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness?\nWe chose \u2018helpful, honest, and harmless\u2019 as criteria because they are simple and memorable, and seem to capture the majority of what we want from an aligned1\n1\nWe also discuss the HHH specification in relation to our broader understanding of alignment in Appendix E. AI. But these are also subtle and ambiguous criteria, and the best AI behavior will involve a compromise between them. For example, there will clearly be conflicts between helpfulness to the user and harmlessness to others if agents are asked to aid in harmful activities. Here are some very brief notes on these terms:\n\nHelpful:\n\nThe AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as this isn\u2019t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible.\n\nWhen more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion.\n\nIdeally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked \u2018how can I build a website in assembly language\u2019 it might suggest a different approach.\n\nHonest:\n\nAt its most basic level, the AI should give accurate information. Moreover, it should be calibrated (e.g. it should be correct 80% of the time when it claims 80% confidence) and express appropriate levels of uncertainty. It should express its uncertainty without misleading human users.\n\nCrucially, the AI should be honest about its own capabilities and levels of knowledge \u2013 it is not sufficient for it to simply imitate the responses expected from a seemingly humble and honest expert.\n\nIdeally the AI would also be honest about itself and its own internal state, insofar as that information is available to it.\n\nHonesty is more objective than helpfulness and harmlessness. Therefore more aspects of honesty training may be possible without human input. This might include calibration training on factual claims and claims about the internal state of the model, and the use of search to augment accuracy.\n\nHarmless:\n\nThe AI should not be offensive or discriminatory, either directly or through subtext or bias.\n\nWhen asked to aid in a dangerous act (e.g. building a bomb), the AI should politely refuse. Ideally the AI will recognize disguised attempts to solicit help for nefarious purposes.\n\nTo the best of its abilities, the AI should recognize when it may be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care.\n\nWhat behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will vary across people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of the user query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used.\n\nAll of these criteria are at least somewhat subjective, and those who deploy an AI will need to take responsibility for the way that alignment is defined and the extent to which it has been attained."}

At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.[13] The nation consists of the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article topic: Current status and plans\n\nStatus of the project (as of February 2022)\nThe California High Speed Rail Authority is continually reevaluating how to bring the project authorized by voters into existence, and revising its plans accordingly. Every two years they must present a business plan to the legislature. Highlights of the Draft 2022 Business Plan include:\n\nCurrently 119 miles (192 km) of right-of-way are under construction in the Central Valley, but an additional 52 miles (84 km) are necessary at the ends to extend the system to Merced and Bakersfield to make an effective HSR system segment. Due to current financial (and other) constraints, the Authority will focus on five actions:\n\nAdding the additional 52 miles (84 km) to the right-of-way (33 miles (53 km) north to Merced, and 17 miles (27 km) south to Bakersfield) and launching a 171-mile (275-km) HSR operable segment between Merced and Bakersfield (linking three high growth areas in the Central Valley). The environmental approvals are completed for both extensions, and work on route acquisition and construction will be performed as funding is available. The Merced station (at the north end) will provide a transfer point to the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) and San Joaquins (Amtrak) rail routes to Sacramento and the Bay Area (San Francisco and Oakland), and the Bakersfield station (at the south end) will have a transfer to Thruway Bus Service for travel to Southern California.\nIn 2022, the contract for the Track and System construction will be let for the 119-mile (192-km) segment. Recently it was found that power availability along the route is inadequate in places, so that will also need to be remedied. When the initial 119 miles (192 km) of right-of-way are completed, and track and necessary signaling and power are installed, there will be a two-year period of testing HSR trainsets, trackage, and control systems while the construction proceeds on the north and south extensions.\nAlso, by the end of 2023, all the route selection, preliminary planning, and environmental approvals necessary will be completed for the entire 500-mile (805-km) Phase 1 system. Thus, it will be ready to be constructed when funding becomes available. As of January 2022, roughly 300 miles (483 km) have been approved. In particular, the route from Merced to Palmdale and from Burbank to Los Angeles has been approved. Further segments expected to be approved in 2022 are San Francisco to San Jose and San Jose to Merced. Palmdale to Burbank and Los Angeles to Anaheim section are expected to be approved in 2023.[11]\nOther \u201cbookend\u201d investments to advance HSR projects will continue: (a) electrification of Caltrain and grade separations (plus other related improvements) in the 51 miles (82 km) between San Francisco and San Jose in Northern California, and (b) in Southern California projects to upgrade and ready LA\u2019s Union Station and other improvements. These investments will provide immediate benefits in more efficient, more environmentally beneficial, and safer operation of higher speed trains in the San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. These modifications will also make those transit systems ready for the inclusion of HSR trainsets when linked in the Phase 1 system, since the HSR trainsets will be sharing trackage and have integrated schedules with local transit.\nWhen ready, the initially operational HSR system (171 miles (275 km) long) will be opened to public use under a contracted Early Train Operator. The system would then be composed of four stations (Merced, Fresno, Kings/Tulare, and Bakersfield), use four trainsets on a single track (with passing tracks), and operate at a speed of 180 mph (290 km/h). Double tracking, additional trainsets, and the Madera station will be added as resources and needs permit. An earlier projection indicated that this system could be operational by 2029, but no commitment was made in the Revised 2020 Business Plan. More recently, on its website the Authority says (as of November 2021) it plans to \"Commence testing of the electrified high-speed system in 2025, certify trains by 2027, and put electrified high-speed trains in service by the end of the decade.\"[12]\nA major addition to the development and operation plan is a new emphasis on risk analysis and risk mitigation, with these integrated into the formal authorization process. Also, contingency reserves are being increased. Current revenue and expense projections indicate that getting the 171-mile (275-km) segment operable is feasible.\n\nAfter the effort of building the current 171-mile (275-km) segment, the next priority is to complete the next extension (going further west and north) to connect to Gilroy and San Jose (the southern terminus of the Caltrain system). This will allow HSR trainsets to run from San Francisco to Bakersfield.\n\nThe complete 500-mile (805-km) Phase 1 system between San Francisco and Anaheim in earlier plans was to be completed in 2033, however, this has been slowed by unanticipated issues. The Phase 2 extensions to Sacramento and San Diego are still in the preliminary planning stages.\n\nThese plans are discussed in detail in the Revised 2020 Business Plan [1]. The impact of COVID-19 on the work in progress in 2020 was discussed in detail. Also, the independent Peer Review Group Letter analyzing the plan was included in Appendices E & F. The next required update of the Business Plan will be in 2022.\n\nThe project will require legislative action in the next couple years, so the issues raised by the Peer Review Group and the project consultant (KPMG) will help the legislature select from the Board's proposed plans or other alternatives. The legislative decisions will profoundly affect the course of the project."}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.[a] These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[4][5] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[6]\n\nIn November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange over allegations of sexual misconduct.[7] Assange said the allegations were a pretext for his extradition from Sweden to the United States over his role in the publication of secret American documents.[8][9] After losing his battle against extradition to Sweden, he breached bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London in June 2012.[10] He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012[11] on the grounds of political persecution, with the presumption that if he were extradited to Sweden, he would be eventually extradited to the US.[12] Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019, saying their evidence had \"weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.\"[13]\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. election campaign, WikiLeaks published confidential Democratic Party emails, showing that the party's national committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival Bernie Sanders in the primaries.[14]\n\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities.[15] The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested.[16] He was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison.[17] The United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange related to the leaks provided by Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as press freedom organisations, criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act, characterising it as an attack on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press.[18][19] On 4 January 2021, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled against the United States' request to extradite him and stated that doing so would be \"oppressive\" given concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide.[20] On 6 January 2021, Assange was denied bail, pending an appeal by the United States.[21] On 10 December 2021, the High Court in London ruled that Assange can be extradited to the US to face the charges.[22]\n\nAssange has been confined in Belmarsh maximum-security prison in London since April 2019.[23]"}

{"prompt": "I don't understand what this article is saying. Did the WNBA player do something to offend Russians? \"The arrest of two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist Brittney Griner has left supporters anxious about her well-being and fearful that she might become a political pawn.\n\nRussian authorities said Griner had cannabis oil in her luggage and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance \u2013 an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear exactly when Griner was arrested last month, or where she\u2019s being detained now.\n\nBut escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has stoked concerns that getting Griner out of Russia will be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Adaora Elonu, a former WBNA player who has also played in Russia, said she was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about Griner. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just very, very concerned \u2013 also knowing that she\u2019s been there for quite some time,\u201d Elonu told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nShe described feeling detached from much of the world while living in Russia. \u201cBeing in Russia, I was kind of in a bubble,\u201d Elonu said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel unsafe. I felt as if there was not much happening in that country. I know there was a lot going on outside of the country. But as far as when I was in Russia, we weren\u2019t getting much news about what was happening. Aside from my family and friends and my agent, they were letting me know about what was happening. But it was hard to balance what was actually happening and what I felt,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut once things started escalating, my agent was definitely pushing for me to get out. And I\u2019m glad I listened to his advice and got out.\u201d\n\n\u2018There are no words to express this pain\u2019\nGriner\u2019s whereabouts aren\u2019t publicly known. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment but has not heard back. A member of Russia\u2019s Federal Customs Service described the charge against Griner to Russia 24, the country\u2019s main state-owned news channel.\n\n\u201cA criminal case has been opened against an American citizen under section 2 of 229 YK RF (Russian law) for smuggling of a significant amount of drugs,\u201d Irina Begisheva of the Main Directorate for the Fight Against Smuggling of the Federal Customs Service told Russia 24.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Griner\u2019s wife described the agony of waiting.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018stay busy.\u2019 Yet, there\u2019s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.\u201d Cherelle Griner posted Monday.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express this pain. I\u2019m hurting, we\u2019re hurting.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, she thanked supporters and asked for privacy \u201cas we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.\u201d But a member of the US House Armed Services Committee said \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult\u201d to get Griner out of Russia.\n\n\u201cOur diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\u201d Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cPerhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cRussia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws\u201d \u2013 though it\u2019s not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner\u2019s case. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.\u201d\n\nGriner\u2019s high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she worries Griner\u2019s case will be used for political purposes.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear is that ... she will become a political pawn,\u201d Jackson told CNN.\n\nBut the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe best news we got today was that they know about it and that she\u2019s on the agenda,\u201d Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner\u2019s hometown of Houston, told reporters.\n\nNoting a potential 10-year sentence for Griner, Jackson Lee added: \u201cWe know about Brittney Griner, and we know that we have to move on her situation.\u201d\n\nA storied career\nGriner has spent her entire WNBA career with the Phoenix Mercury and won the league\u2019s championship in 2014. The WNBA has confirmed that all other league players have departed Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLike many other WNBA players, Griner plays overseas in the offseason where salaries can be much higher than what female professional basketball players are paid in the US.\n\nShe won the EuroLeague Women championship last year with Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she has played since 2015 during her offseasons.\n\nFans around the world have called for Griner\u2019s release, with more than 34,000 people signing the \u201cSecure Brittney Griner\u2019s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.\u201d petition on Change.org as of Tuesday.\""}

The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign.\n\nThe White House has not said whether Biden supports it. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to say if she supports the measure but said she was reviewing it closely.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said supporters agreed the change would not take place until November 2023 after input from airlines and broadcasters.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,\" Rubio said. \"If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore.\"\n\n\"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come,\" he added.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores opposes the change, telling Congress this month \"we should not have kids going to school in the dark.\"\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\nA man runs near the reflecting pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument at sunrise on the National Mall in Washington\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\n\nSince 2015, about 30 states have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue last week, where Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said, \"The loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nAt the hearing, Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division, argued daylight savings time makes it harder to be alert in the morning, saying it \"is like living in the wrong time zone for almost eight months out of the year.\"\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change. They argue the measure could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nDaylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was used during World War Two and adopted again in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."}

I remember 25 years ago we were 12, 11, wishing that we had the opportunity or the means to come up to Cleveland and see some of the greatest basketball players of all time because they inspired us so much.\"\n\nTeam LeBron entered the fourth quarter with a 139-138 lead over Team Durant, setting the target score at 163 (24 more than the leading team entering the final frame).

And much more quickly than previously assessed by the IPCC.\n\nRight now, as the new report makes clear, around 40% of the world's population is \"highly vulnerable\" to the impacts of climate change.\n\nBut the burden is falling mainly on those who did the least to cause the problem.\n\n\"For Africa around 30% of all the maize growing areas will go out of production, for beans it's around 50% on the current emissions trajectory,\" said Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, which assists governments and the private sector in pushing for large scale adaptation solutions.\n\n\"So there are certain parts of the world, particularly in Africa, which will become uninhabitable.\"\n\n\"And time is running out, as the IPCC report clearly says, to stop the forces driving this new climate apartheid,\" he told BBC News.\n\n2 - Loss and damage gets scientific backing\nFor several years, developing countries have been trying to get richer nations to take the idea of loss and damage seriously.\n\nIt's defined as those impacts of climate change that can't be adapted to, or slow onset events like sea level rise.\n\nIt has been very controversial because it is bound up with the long-term historical responsibility for carbon emissions - and richer nations fear being dragged through the courts and forced to pay indefinitely for current and future losses and damages that they have contributed to.\n\nAt COP26 in Glasgow, political progress on the issue stalled when the US and EU blocked a dedicated funding facility for loss and damage.\n\nNow the IPCC clearly states that the observed impacts of climate change include \"widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.\"\n\nThe endorsement by the IPCC is likely to give loss and damage a major boost in climate talks, a fact recognised by the UK's COP President, Alok Sharma, who is in charge of UN negotiations until COP27 begins in Egypt later this year.\n\n\"Today's report underscores the urgency with which we must prepare for climate change and address a new reality of loss and damage, especially in the world's most climate-vulnerable communities,\" he said. \"The next decade is crucial.\"\n\n3 - Technology is not a silver bullet\nAccording to the IPCC, the use of some technologies designed to limit warming or reduce CO2 could make matters worse rather than better.\n\nThere are also worries that machines that suck CO2 from the air could simply trigger the release of more warming gas.\n\n\"If you remove CO2 from the atmosphere, you'll get a rebound effect from the others in the carbon cycle,\" said Linda Schneider from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, who was an observer at the IPCC discussions.\n\n\"The oceans, the land reservoirs, will have an outgassing effect. And so some of the CO2 that that you removed from the atmosphere will be returned to the atmosphere.\"\n\n4 - Cities offer hope\nWhile large cities are hotspots for climate impacts, they also offer a real opportunity to avoid the worst impacts of warming.\n\nAs cities continue to grow they can push for renewable energy, greener transport, and buildings. This could limit destructive climate impacts for millions.\n\n\"We point very clearly to the cities of the world as a key place for mobilisation,\" said IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts.\n\n\"This is where some of our most vulnerable people are located in coastal cities so that's already an entry point, you can change your options by beginning to mobilise around coastal urban development.\"\n\n5 - The small window is closing fast.\nWhile this is a bleak assessment of the impacts now and in the future, the authors remain convinced that the worst impacts can be averted - if we act in time.\n\nThe IPCC says this opportunity for action will only last for the rest of this decade, as the final sentence in the new report underlines.\n\n\"Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.\"\n\nIf the world can cut emissions drastically and significantly boost spending on adaptation, that could avoid locking in certain disaster.\n\nAnd it's not just about spending on green energy and electric cars. The authors say that investing in education, health systems and social justice could help people to cope with the impacts of rising temperatures.\n\nInvesting in nature will also be a bulwark against the worst, says the IPCC, which calls for 30-50% of the world to be conserved.\n\n\"Nature can be our saviour,\" said Inger Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Programme.\n\n\"But only if we save it first.\""}

{"prompt": "I was wondering why we don't eat turkey eggs. I assume it has to be because they just don't taste good. Is that what this article says? \"According to the National Turkey Federation, the average American ate 16 pounds of turkey in 2012.  On Thanksgiving alone, it\u2019s estimated Americans consume 46 million turkeys.  And even though turkey eggs are edible and similar in taste to chicken eggs, they aren\u2019t as widely consumed. \n\nThe economics of egg production lend a sizable advantage to producing chicken eggs over turkey eggs.  Patty Fuhs of Turkey Downs, a turkey farm in Montgomery, Ind., says most turkey producers use turkey eggs for producing more turkeys rather than selling the eggs.  She says turkeys are more expensive and require more time to produce eggs, consume twice as much feed and lay one-third as many eggs as chickens. \n\nThe average size of a turkey is 16 to 17 pounds compared to 3 to 4 pounds for an average sized chicken.  A chicken lays approximately 300 eggs per year while the average turkey produces only 100 or so.  Not only do turkeys produce fewer eggs but they also require more time to come into egg production.  Chickens come into production at 19 to 20 weeks, while turkeys require 32 weeks. \n\nTurkeys also tend to go broody easily which could hinder a large scale turkey egg operation.  Broodiness occurs when a bird wants to sit on their eggs and incubate them.  Chickens have broodiness bred out of them and otherwise have no desire to incubate their offspring and be maternal.\n\nCulinary factors also contribute to the dearth of turkey egg consumption.  Turkey eggs have a thicker and tougher shell membrane and are harder to break than chicken eggs.  Furthermore, most recipes are designed for the amount of liquid in a chicken egg.  The weight of a large chicken egg is 50 grams, while the weight of a turkey egg is 80 grams. Such a difference could cause dreadful results in ones pumpkin pie.\n\nFred Schnell of Gobble Development in Birdseye, Ind. whose operation produces male turkeys called toms rather than female egg-laying turkey hens says that some people eat what are called mound oysters from the toms.  Mound oysters are turkey testicles -- different type of egg, says Schnell. \n\nThere are health and regulatory concerns with producing turkey eggs as well.  Feed ingredients can be transferred from a turkey hen to an egg and the USDA must clear these ingredients as safe for human consumption.  And while these ingredients have been cleared for chickens, they have not been cleared for turkeys.\""}

Wayne\u2019s enlisted his girlfriend Maxine (Mia Goth), Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and Jackson (Scott Mescudi) to star. Then he\u2019s rented a boarding house on the cheap from the reclusive, elder Howard (Stephen Ure), who warns them to stay out of his wife\u2019s sight.\n\nThe porn production quickly devolves into a fucked up horror picture when things spiral out of control.\n\nTi West's 'X' Highlights Horror Films Premiering at SXSW's 2022 Film Festival!\n\nWest has many surprises in store for X, but the first straight out of the gate is just how wickedly funny it is. From the little details like \u201cPlowing Service\u201d emblazoned across Wayne\u2019s van to the consistent tongue-in-cheek euphemisms befitting of the adult film production, X has a delightfully wicked sense of humor. Snow and Mescudi stand out for their line delivery and comedic timing; their character gags and one-liners land with perfection.\n\nThe second significant shock in store is how fiercely the filmmaker matches the comedy with the horror. While it\u2019s no surprise that West knows how to build tension, he brings it to a whole new level here. West, who co-edits with David Kashevaroff, finds ingenious and innovative ways to create edge-of-your-seat suspense through editing. Spliced scenes don\u2019t just create visual interest; they deliver potent scares. Overhead shots instill unease, a masterclass of terror and foreshadowing with gratifyingly intense payoffs later. West\u2019s intoxicating blend of style and scare-crafting creates a visceral horror experience.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the gore of it all. X is a crowd-pleasing doozy when it comes to brutal bloodletting and kills. Some deaths leave you queasy, and some will leave you cackling with glee. All of it is immensely satisfying.\n\nX is West firing on all cylinders. The commitment to the period is top-level, capturing the aesthetic and vibe without ever coming close to feeling pastiche. It\u2019s all the more impressive considering just how much humor gets injected, which could\u2019ve pushed this into spoof territory quickly in other hands. The editing is a masterclass, a marvel of how West structures this wild tale to maximize the tension or offer reprieve through an onslaught of terror.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cast. The lean, straightforward narrative gets straight to the goods and never wastes time on heavy exposition. It\u2019s all in the little details and the talented cast making these characters feel lived-in with a shared history. We root for this wacky, free-spirited bunch because they\u2019re so charming and genuine. Naturally, it lends well to the horror\u2019s impact.\n\nThe setting and period make for easy comparisons to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and West uses that to lull viewers before pulling the rug out from under them. They share similar DNA and pure grit, but it\u2019s a narratively different beast that demonstrates why West should be given full reign to go full throttle on deranged, savage, and intense horror-comedies more often. It\u2019s a blast.\n\nX releases in theaters on March 18, 2022."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about colloidal silver for me in a few bullet points?\n\nMany consider colloidal silver an antiseptic and not an antibiotic because it kills more than bacteria; it destroys viruses and eliminates fungal infections. So far, bacteria that are resistant to silver haven\u2019t developed, while colloidal silver can destroy antibiotic-resistant pathogens, even the dreaded MRSA.\n\nAs a matter of fact, now the medical mafia has been covertly adding colloidal silver into antibiotics to conquer the super-bug strains that have developed immunity to those antibiotics. I say covertly because they aren\u2019t talking too much about it!\n\nKeep in mind that while antibiotics don\u2019t touch viruses and fungus\u2019s, colloidal silver eliminates them \u2013 making colloidal silver benefits incredibly useful. It eliminates anaerobic pathogens by destroying the enzymes that fend off oxygen molecules, thus oxidizing them to death.\n\nConversely, the silver nano-particles neutralize the minority of aerobic pathogens by disrupting their ability to use oxygen. This begs the question: will colloidal silver destroy friendly gut bacteria the way pharmaceutical antibiotics do? Some colloidal silver advocates claim it is so readily assimilated into the blood through the stomach and gut linings before it can linger in the lower intestines where our friendly bacteria mostly reside. Therefore,  it isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nOthers consider electrical charge bonding as the main factor for eliminating pathogens while sparing gut friendly bacteria. Most friendly bacteria are not negatively charged, eliminating any attraction to the positively charged silver particles.\n\nHowever, a couple of key colloidal advocates, one from whom I purchased my colloidal silver making machine, don\u2019t think that the intestinal flora issue has been clearly established. They recommend the following:\n\nHave probiotic materials on hand and use them an hour or more after ingesting colloidal silver.\nSwish and hold a dose of colloidal silver in your mouth to absorb most of the particles sublingually into the bloodstream through the capillaries under and around your tongue as long as possible before swallowing.\nNebulize the colloidal silver solution, making it go directly into your bloodstream via the lungs blood vessels.\nAs magnetic scavengers, they don\u2019t have to collide into pathogens by chance the way antibiotics do. Because the tiny colloidal silver particles (colloids) have strong positive charges, they are attracted to or attract negatively charged microbes, including viruses."}

Cool the burn. Immediately immerse the burn in cool tap water or apply cold, wet compresses. Do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides.\n\n2. Apply petroleum jelly two to three times daily. Do not apply ointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn, as these may cause an infection. Do not apply topical antibiotics.\n\n3. Cover the burn with a nonstick, sterile bandage. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered. Do not pop the blisters.\n\n4. Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation.\n\n5. Protect the area from the sun. Once the burn heals, protect the area from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. This will help minimize scarring, as the redness from a burn sometimes persists for weeks, especially in those with darker skin tones."}

{"prompt": "Matteo Ricci was an Italian Jesuit missionary, born on 06 October 1552 in Macerata, Italy. He studied law in Rome and join the Society of Jesus in 1571. After studying science, Ricci volunteered to be a missionary in the East. He went to India in 1578 and to China in 1583 to spread the Gospel. In China, Ricci settled in Guangdong Province, where he studied the Chinese language, adopted and observed the Chinese customs and traditions, and thus easily made friends. Ricci gave the Chinese their understanding of the West and vice versa by providing the Europeans with an accurate description of China. With the help of a map he made for them, Chinese intellectuals saw their country\u2019s location in the world for the first time. In 1597, Ricci was appointed director of Jesuits activities in China. Four years later, he finally achieved his goal of being admitted to Chinese capital of Beijing where he preached, supervised the four stations of his mission, and taught science to Chinese scholars. Moreover, Ricci translated Christian works into Chinese, wrote books in Chinese, and gave Europe its first modern account of the Chinese Empire. He died on 11 May 1610 in Beijing, Ricci\u2019s considered second home. When was Matteo Ricci finally admitted to Beijing, where he preached and taught science to Chinese scholars?"}

These 10 water-saving tips will put you on the path to conserving water in your household.\n\nPut a brick in your toilet\u2019s water tank. You flush an average of 20 gallons of water a day down the toilet. If you don\u2019t have a high-efficiency toilet, try filling your tank with something that will displace some of that water, such as a brick.\n\nUse the right amount of water for each load of laundry. Typically 15-40 percent of indoor home water use comes from doing laundry. Save water by making sure to adjust the settings on your machine to the proper load size.\n\nPick your washing machine wisely. When considering top-load vs. front-load washers, front-loading washing machines generally use less water.\n\nWater plants wisely. Water your lawn or garden early in the morning or late in the evening, so the water lasts and is not immediately evaporated by the hot sun.\nInstall a low-flow showerhead. With a low-flow showerhead, you can save 15 gallons of water during a 10-minute shower.\n\nCheck for and repair leaks. An average of 10,000 gallons of water is wasted every year due to household leaks. One of the most effective ways to cut your water footprint is to repair leaky faucets and toilets.\n\nUse a dishwasher. Dishwashing accounts for less than 2 percent of indoor water use, but using a machine is actually more water efficient than hand washing, especially if you run full loads. ENERGY STAR\u00ae dishwashers save about 1,600 gallons of water over its lifetime of use.\nTurn off the water. Teach your whole household to turn off the faucet while brushing teeth or shaving. Every little bit of water conservation helps!\n\nDefrost food in the fridge. Instead of running frozen foods under hot water from the faucet, build in time to let them defrost in the refrigerator.\n\nManage outdoor water use. Don\u2019t forget about water conservation outside as well. Equip all hoses with shut-off nozzles, which can prevent hose leaks."}

{"prompt": "Matteo Ricci was an Italian Jesuit missionary, born on 06 October 1552 in Macerata, Italy. He studied law in Rome and join the Society of Jesus in 1571. After studying science, Ricci volunteered to be a missionary in the East. He went to India in 1578 and to China in 1583 to spread the Gospel. In China, Ricci settled in Guangdong Province, where he studied the Chinese language, adopted and observed the Chinese customs and traditions, and thus easily made friends. Ricci gave the Chinese their understanding of the West and vice versa by providing the Europeans with an accurate description of China. With the help of a map he made for them, Chinese intellectuals saw their country\u2019s location in the world for the first time. In 1597, Ricci was appointed director of Jesuits activities in China. Four years later, he finally achieved his goal of being admitted to Chinese capital of Beijing where he preached, supervised the four stations of his mission, and taught science to Chinese scholars. Moreover, Ricci translated Christian works into Chinese, wrote books in Chinese, and gave Europe its first modern account of the Chinese Empire. He died on 11 May 1610 in Beijing, Ricci\u2019s considered second home. When was Matteo Ricci finally admitted to Beijing, where he preached and taught science to Chinese scholars?"}

{"prompt": "Can you put the important facts in this article into bullet points? The blood, bones, feathers and liver tissue of 1,210 eagles sampled from 2010 to 2018 were examined to assess chronic and acute lead exposure.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time for any wildlife species that we\u2019ve been able to evaluate lead exposure and population level consequences at a continental scale,\u201d said study co-author Todd Katzner, a wildlife biologist at U.S. Geological Survey in Boise, Idaho. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning that nearly 50% of them are getting repeatedly exposed to lead.\u201d\n\nLead is a neurotoxin that even in low doses impairs an eagle\u2019s balance and stamina, reducing its ability to fly, hunt and reproduce. In high doses, lead causes seizures, breathing difficulty and death.\n\nThe study estimated that lead exposure reduced the annual population growth of bald eagles by 4% and golden eagles by 1%.\n\nBald eagles are one of America\u2019s most celebrated conservation success stories, and the birds were removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007.\n\nBut scientists say that high lead levels are still a concern. Besides suppressing eagle population growth, lead exposure reduces their resilience in facing future challenges, such as climate change or infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about recovery, it\u2019s not really the end of the story \u2014 there are still threats to bald eagles,\u201d said Krysten Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist at Cornell University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, who was not involved in the study.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrevious studies have shown high lead exposure in specific regions, but not across the country. The blood samples from live eagles in the new study were taken from birds trapped and studied for other reasons; the bone, feather and liver samples came from eagles killed by collisions with vehicles or powerlines, or other misfortunes.\n\n\u201cLead is present on the landscape and available to these birds more than we previously thought,\u201d said co-author Vince Slabe, a research wildlife biologist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Global. \u201cA lead fragment the size of the end of a pin is large enough to cause mortality in an eagle. \u201d\n\nThe researchers also found elevated levels of lead exposure in fall and winter, coinciding with hunting season in many states.\n\nDuring these months, eagles scavenge on carcasses and gut piles left by hunters, which are often riddled with shards of lead shot or bullet fragments.\n\nSlabe said the upshot of the research was not to disparage hunters. \u201cHunters are one of the best conservation groups in this country,\u201d he said, noting that fees and taxes paid by hunters help fund state wildlife agencies, and that he also hunted deer and elk in Montana.\n\nHowever, Slabe said he hopes the findings provide an opportunity to \u201ctalk to hunters about this issue in a clear manner\u201d and that more hunters will voluntarily switch to non-lead ammunition such as copper bullets.\n\nLead ammunition for waterfowl hunting was banned in 1991, due to concerns about contamination of waterways, and wildlife authorities encouraged the use of nontoxic steel shot. However, lead ammunition is still common for upland bird hunting and big game hunting.\n\nThe amount of lead exposure varies regionally, with highest levels found in the Central Flyway, the new study found.\n\nAt the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center, veterinarian and executive director Victoria Hall said that \u201c85 to 90% of the eagles that come into our hospital have some level of lead in their blood,\u201d and X-rays often show fragments of lead bullets in their stomachs.\n\nEagles with relatively low levels can be treated, she said, but those with high exposure can\u2019t be saved.\n\nLaura Hale, board president at nonprofit Badger Run Wildlife Rehab in Klamath County, Oregon, said she\u2019ll never forget the first eagle she encountered with acute lead poisoning, in 2018. She had answered a resident\u2019s call about an eagle that seemed immobile in underbrush and brought it to the clinic.\n\nThe young bald eagle was wrapped in a blanket, unable to breathe properly, let alone stand or fly.\n\n\u201cThere is something hideous when you watch an eagle struggling to breathe because of lead poisoning \u2013 it\u2019s really, really harsh,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. That eagle went into convulsions, and died within 48 hours.\n\nLead on the landscape affects not only eagles, but also many other birds \u2014 including hawks, vultures, ravens, swans and geese, said Jennifer Cedarleaf, avian director at Alaska Raptor Center, a nonprofit wildlife rescue in Sitka, Alaska.\n\nBecause eagles are very sensitive to lead, are so well-studied and attract so much public interest, \u201cbald eagles are like the canary in the coal mine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the species that tells us: We have a bit of problem.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into three sentences: Overthinking is an anxious tendency that I encounter often in my psychotherapy practice. There are many ways we tend to overthink, such as rehashing the past \u2014 replaying the same scenario over and over in our head. Worrying is another form, in which we obsess over what the future might bring.\n\nI can empathize. When I was younger, overthinking decreased my quality of life. Research has shown that overthinking can decrease energy, limit creativity and cause sleeping problems.\n\nEventually, I knew I needed a healthy way to cope, and I created a career out of helping other people do the same. Here are three strategies I use every day to stop overthinking:\n1. Positive reframing\n\nThis is often confused with \u201ctoxic positivity,\u201d which asks people to think positively \u2014 no matter how difficult a situation is.\n\nPositive reframing, on the other hand, allows you to acknowledge the negative aspects, then asks you to evaluate whether there\u2019s another way to think about the situation. Perhaps there are benefits or things you can change about it.\n\nExample:\n\nYou constantly find yourself complaining: \u201cI hate being a boss. On top of all these deadlines and responsibilities, it\u2019s hard to manage so many complex personalities. It\u2019s emotionally and mentally exhausting. My job just sucks.\u201d\n\nVenting might feel good for a second, but it doesn\u2019t solve anything. And you\u2019ll likely continue to dwell on how much you hate your job or how bad you think you are at managing.\n\nTo practice positive reframing, replace the thought above with: \u201cThings are challenging right now and I\u2019m feeling disconnected from some things on my plate. I wonder if I can change anything about this situation or my expectations about it.\u201d\n\nThis thought pattern gives you the power to change your situation. You could start small by examining what important tasks needs to get done first, then either delay or delegate the rest until you are feeling less anxious. The key is to take a step back and deal with things one at a time.\n2. Write down your thoughts once, then distract yourself for 24 hours\n\nWhen our brains think we are in conflict or danger, a built-in alarm system goes off internally to protect us.\n\nOne thing I have found success with is writing down my feelings and waiting at least 24 hours (or just a few hours if it\u2019s an urgent matter) before replying or taking any sort of impulsive action.\n\nThen, I put that draft away while I distract myself with another task.\n\nExample:\n\nYou just received an email about something that went awry. You are upset, your heart starts to race, your breathing gets shallow, and you become hyper-focused on what\u2019s going wrong and why it\u2019s your fault.\n\nIf you respond to the email while your brain is in \u201calarm mode,\u201d you might say things you\u2019ll regret later on, which may then fuel the vicious cycle of overthinking.\n\nWriting negative thoughts down takes the power out of them; I often don\u2019t feel the need to take action based on my anxious thoughts once I\u2019ve written them down. \n3. Practice \u2018specific gratitude\u2019\n\nIn psychology, we know that expressing gratitude can increase our happiness. It can help us contextualize our frustrations against what we love and help us connect to something larger than ourselves \u2014 whether that\u2019s other people, animals, nature or a higher power.\n\nBut I find that repeating the same gratitude practice over and over again can become rote and diminish the returns. For me, it can start to feel like a meaningless chore instead of a mindful practice. So, I like to practice something that I call \u201cspecific gratitude.\u201d\n\nExample:\n\nInstead of writing in my journal every day that \u201cI am grateful for my health,\u201d I\u2019ll write something like, \u201cI am grateful that I woke up today without any back pain and have the ability to do today\u2019s workout.\u201d\n\nThis helps me stay focused on the here and now, rather than overthinking on general abstractions. Tomorrow, I might still be grateful for my health, but I might specifically be grateful that I have enough energy for a long run."}

Yes, some fruits are high in carbohydrates and natural sugars. No, that's not a reason to avoid them.\n\nFruit supplies you with so many healthy nutrients and cancer-fighting antioxidants, they shouldn't be ignored by the carb-phobic. In fact, shunning fruit may make it harder to lose weight.\n\n\"Fresh, whole fruits help reduce belly fat and help with weight loss because they are naturally low in calories, high in volume because of the naturally occurring water in them, and are anti-inflammatory, which can help in fat loss,\" says Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, a senior dietitian at UCLA Medical Center and author of the new book Recipe for Survival.\n\n\"Inflammation increases fat deposition in the body, especially in the abdomen region, while anti-inflammatory foods, like fruits, can help burn fat in those regions.\"\n\nIf you want to get back on the fruit wagon, which fruits are the best?\n\n\"Pretty much, any fresh fruit is good for weight loss and health, because of their water content and low-calorie content,\" says Hunnes, who is also an environmentalist studying climate change. She advises avoiding dried fruit because they are calories dense, having the water dehydrated out of them. Also, nix other processed fruits that have been turned into juice or candy because they have been stripped of health benefits and are \"just concentrated sugar at that point,\" she says."}

Webb is already sending back proof of its prowess with a new alignment evaluation image that shows a gleaming star against a background of galaxies.\n\nIt's been a long road, and the image marks a triumphant milestone. \"More than 20 years ago, the Webb team set out to build the most powerful telescope that anyone has ever put in space and came up with an audacious optical design to meet demanding science goals,\" said Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Today we can say that design is going to deliver.\"  \n\nWebb is a complex beast. It uses 18 hexagonal mirror segments that had to be folded up for launch and then unfolded and aligned in space. We've been following the process and seeing increasingly sharper and more focused views of the telescope's target star leading up to this week's image release.\n\nThe star itself is beautiful to look at, but a highlight of the new image is the background and the array of galaxies and stars that appear there. It's a testament to the telescope's sensitivity that it can see so much in just this test image.\n\nMarch 11 marked the completion of an alignment stage called \"fine phasing.\" \"At this key stage in the commissioning of Webb's Optical Telescope Element, every optical parameter that has been checked and tested is performing at, or above, expectations,\" NASA said.\n\nThe Webb team will take the telescope through more alignment steps over the next six weeks. The observatory will then go through a two-month process of preparing its science instruments before it's ready to tackle its mission in earnest. If all continues to go well, we could see Webb's first full-resolution imagery this summer."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the harmful chemical found in products? Please summarize the article in 3 or 4 sentences for me. \n\nIndependent testing has found hundreds of popular personal care items in the US to be contaminated with benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, prompting several big brands to voluntarily recall dozens of products in recent months.\n\nThe lab, Valisure, last year detected benzene in hand sanitizers, sunscreens, deodorant, dry shampoos, conditioners, antiperspirants, deodorants, body sprays and anti-fungal treatments. The contamination has been most frequently detected in aerosol or spray products, some at levels the Food and Drug Administration characterized as \u201clife-threatening\u201d.\n\nThe findings suggest that benzene contamination is widespread and is probably in more products that have not yet been tested, said David Light, Valisure\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cBenzene really shouldn\u2019t be there at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a fundamental problem in the manufacturing of a lot of consumer products.\u201d To date, Valisure has tested 662 items and found the chemical in 180, or about 27%, of products.\n\nProcter & Gamble, Bayer, CVS and Johnson & Johnson have issued voluntary recalls for widely distributed brands including Brut, Sure, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Old Spice, Secret, Tinactin, Lotrimin, Coppertone, Neutrogena and Aveeno. Among the recalled hand sanitizer brands are Art Naturals, Best Brands and Natural Wunderz.\n\nLight pointed to \u201cdecades of research\u201d that has found no safe levels of benzene exposure because it\u2019s so toxic at very low levels. The petroleum-based chemical \u201ccauses cancer\u201d, especially leukemia and in blood forming organs, the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote. The toxin has also been shown to harm the central nervous system and reproductive organs.\n\nThe US banned benzene\u2019s use as an ingredient nearly 45 years ago, and it is \u201csomewhat unique in that it\u2019s pretty well established to be incredibly toxic \u2013 that\u2019s been known for decades to over a century,\u201d said David Andrews, senior scientist at the public health advocate Environmental Working Group.\n\nAdvocates took aim at the Food and Drug Administration for failing to do more to protect the public. In a December statement, the agency said it was investigating the situation, doing its own testing and urged companies to recall contaminated products.\n\nThough the agency lacks the authority to order recalls and may be limited in its pre-market authority to require testing, advocates are calling on the FDA to clarify an existing benzene limit, set new exposure limits, and conduct more testing of products on store shelves to ensure they are safe, instead of leaving that up to independent labs. The FDA\u2019s system \u201creally lacks independent review\u201d because it relies on companies to self report, Light said.\n\nFederal rules allow benzene to be used in the manufacture of personal care products, and that can cause it to end up in goods, even if it\u2019s not listed as an ingredient. Benzene can also be added in emergency situations, like the pandemic, or if it provides \u201csignificant therapeutic\u201d advantages. In such scenarios, the FDA\u2019s limit is two parts per million, but some products that provided no therapeutic advantage were found with levels as high as 21 ppm.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA wrote it \u201ccontinues to monitor the issue\u201d and work with companies to recall contaminated products. Though the agency doesn\u2019t have exposure limits, it informs companies that \u201csolvents such as benzene should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, or drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity.\u201d\n\nSome companies have capitalized on the confusing regulations and gaps to downplay the problem. Johnson & Johnson, which recalled sunscreens in July, said \u201cdaily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s statement was posted by the FDA on its website even though agency scientists found in a July analysis obtained by Consumer Reports that benzene-contaminated sunscreen did pose a \u201clife-threatening risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cIs the FDA serving these companies or the public?\u201d Andrews asked.\n\nHow benzene is landing in products remains a bit of a mystery in some instances. Companies claim they aren\u2019t adding it to their formulas, and the FDA theorized that it\u2019s probably in contaminated thickening agents, preservatives, spray propellant or ethanol.\n\nIn many cases, Valisure found one batch of a product would contain benzene while another of the same product would not. That highlights the complexities and lack of oversight in the global supply chains that produce personal care products. A propellant like butane that\u2019s refined very early in the manufacturing process \u201ctouches dozens of different hands\u201d in its journey from raw material to sunscreen on a shelf, yet nobody detected benzene, Light said.\n\nValisure most frequently found benzene in body sprays, which includes deodorants and anti-perspirants: nearly half of the 108 products from 30 different brands contained it. The highest levels were found in Sure, Old Spice, Secret, Equate, Right Guard, Tag and Brut.\n\nValisure tested nearly 300 sunscreens or after-sun products and found detectable levels in 77, or about 27%, of samples. Among those with the highest levels were Neutrogena, CVS, Sun Bum, Raw Elements and Banana Boat. Though spray-on sunscreen was found to be contaminated most frequently, the chemical was also detected in lotions and gels.\n\nValisure\u2019s hand sanitizer analysis found the highest levels of benzene in small brands that popped up as demand for the product spiked. Out of 260 samples from 168 brands sold on Amazon, at pharmacies and at box stores such as Target, 44, or about 17%, had detectable levels of benzene. Products from household names like Purell and Suave didn\u2019t contain the chemical.\n\nIn its December statement, TPC Hot Acquisition, which owns Brut and Sure, wrote: \u201cTo date, no reports of adverse events related to this recall have been reported. This voluntary recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s nearly impossible to legally prove that one specific chemical has caused an illness, and Andrews noted benzene has a latency period of 10 to 15 years. \u201cThe time lag between exposure and cancer can be a long period of time,\u201d he said."}

{"prompt": "A Georgia teacher has been suspended after an altercation with a student who brought a gun to school in August 2021.\n\nThe disciplinary action stems from when former Coach Kenneth Miller said he received a video showing guns on Tri-Cities High School grounds, in East Point, according to WSB.\n\nOn their way to an outdoor pep rally that day, the school officials got notice that students were \u201cplanning on doing something,\u201d Miller told Fox News.\n\nHe said the school\u2019s principal asked him to investigate reports that students had brought guns to campus, the outlet reported.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney, Allen Lightcap, said that Miller was asking the student where the guns were when she attacked him. Shortly after the altercation, he said Miller found the gun she brought.\n\nVideo from an officer\u2019s body cam shows that when he went to the student to confront her, the student was agitated and smacked Miller\u2019s hand. He proceeded to push the student against the wall and restrained her until police intervened.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller is the reason all of metro Atlanta does not know the date of August 20, 2021,\u201d Lightcap told McClatchy News in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s because he averted another tragic school shooting that day, and no one was hurt. Everyone went home safe. Coach Miller is the reason these guns were found.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Fulton County School District originally filed a termination charge against Miller, Lightcap said.\n\nThe Fulton County school district told McClatchy News in a statement that Miller \u201cfailed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations.\u201d\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney said his client had \u201cthe right to self defense\u201d in this incident.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true when guns are involved,\u201d Lightcap said in the statement. \u201cTeachers should not be terminated or suspended when it\u2019s clear they were defending themselves.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials scheduled a termination hearing in the case. But Lightcap said the hearing was then \u201cabruptly canceled by the District without Coach Miller\u2019s consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the district has changed its charge to a suspension mid-trial, Coach Miller no longer gets to call witnesses so that the truth can come out,\u201d Lightcap said.In a letter from Ethel Lett, the high school\u2019s principal, shared on the school\u2019s website, Lett said that \u201cbringing a gun or weapon onto a school campus\u201d is a \u201cvery serious offense,\u201d in \u201cclear violation of our Fulton County Schools\u2019 Student Code of Conduct.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the principal announced that the school is exploring steps such as unannounced K-9 dog sweeps and random weapons checks.\n\nMiller received the notice of suspension on March 4. On March 9, Lightcap appealed the 20-day suspension, according to legal documents.\n\nIn the appeal, Lightcap reiterated that Miller \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that he \u201cdefended himself against a student who attacked him.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Officer] Cleveland and [AP] Lawson corroborated Miller\u2019s account that [the student] was the aggressor, was highly agitated, and smacked the phone out of Miller\u2019s hand,\u201d the Personal Investigation Report made on Sept. 13, 2021 said, according to Lightcap.\n\nLightcap wrote in the appeal that the investigation report said all three eye witnesses said they did not witness any misconduct by Miller. But, the attorney added that Fulton Board policies \u201cspecifically exclude witness testimony\u201d when it comes to suspensions versus full terminations.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller asks that the Fulton County drop the suspension and put him back to work at Tri-Cities,\u201d Lightcap said, \u201cIt is never too late to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTeacher caught using racial slur on video is teaching again in North Carolina\n\nTeacher suspended after parents said he taught \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 to Virginia class\n\nHigh school teacher shown in video slapping student is now arrested, Indiana cops say\n\nParent assaulted school resource officer, then drove away, North Carolina cops say     Can you write this in a more concise and professional way?"}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

The helicopter has now traveled more than 4.6 kilometers since its first flight in April 2021.\n\nIngenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, with an original plan of no more than five flights over a month. The excellent performance of the 1.8-kilogram helicopter, though, led NASA to extend its mission, using it as a scout to examine terrain ahead of the Perseverance rover that carried Ingenuity to Mars.\n\nThe information Ingenuity has provided has created some modest time savings for Perseverance. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly shaved several sols, maybe a week, off of the time frame of the rover by having this advanced information,\u201d said Matt Golombek, a senior research scientist at JPL who has been involved with Mars landers dating back to Mars Pathfinder, during a March 8 media briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference. A sol is a Martian day, about 40 minutes longer than a terrestrial day.\n\nOther scientists involved with Perseverance agreed that Ingenuity has been useful. \u201cI was really impressed with how well it worked and how useful it\u2019s been,\u201d said Justin Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center who works on the Perseverance mission, during a conference session March 7. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was fully anticipated, at least by myself.\u201d\n\nKeyron Hickman-Lewis of the U.K.\u2019s Natural History Museum, another Perseverance scientist, said at that conference session that Ingenuity has been particularly helpful as Perseverance negotiated a region called S\u00e9\u00edtah. \u201cThe terrain is not optimal for a rover,\u201d he said of the region. \u201cThese insights have been invaluable.\u201d\n\nThat work will continue as Perseverance heads in the coming weeks to the remnants of a river delta. \u201cThe intent is to keep the helicopter out in front of the rover to provide advance information that would help in its exploration,\u201d Golombek said. That includes scouting paths the rover could take into the delta and identifying rocks for the rover to study with its instrument suite.\n\nIngenuity itself has shown no signs of wear and tear after nearly a year of flying on Mars. \u201cSo far, we have found no degradation or loss of anything on the helicopter. It is as good as new,\u201d he said.\n\nThe helicopter, which uses solar power, also has no consumables to limit its life. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing consumable and nothing to stop us from continuing to operate as long as the helicopter remains healthy,\u201d he said, with the expectation Ingenuity will continue operations until something finally breaks.\n\nThat performance is all the more noteworthy, he added, because of the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts that had been previously qualified for space on Ingenuity, rather than customized components. \u201cIt is rather remarkable that we\u2019ve had no degradation or loss of any aspect of the helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\nGolombek said the performance of Ingenuity demonstrates how useful such helicopters could be in future exploration, although NASA has no firm plans currently for additional helicopter missions. \u201cThe idea of a technology demo is to demonstrate that here is a new way to explore Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cIngenuity has shown the promise of this sort of way to continue our exploration of the red planet.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you help me summarize this article on Milka Pavlovi\u0107 in 7 bullet points or less?\n\nMilka Pavlovi\u0107 (1905 \u2013 18 May 1935) was a Croatian serial killer. A peasant woman living in Stari Pavljani, near Bjelovar, she poisoned family members, relatives and servants with arsenic between March and July 1934, succeeding in killing six and wounding ten others so she could acquire their inheritance. After being convicted of the crimes, she was sentenced to death and subsequently executed.[1]\n\nBiography\nLittle documentation of Pavlovi\u0107's early life exists. She was born in 1905 in the small of village of Kokinac, and at some point, she married Rade Pavlovi\u0107 of nearby Stari Pavljani, moving into his home and finding work as a milkmaid. A childless, bitter woman, Milka was regarded poorly by her fellow villagers.[2]\n\nAround March 1934, she bought arsenic from a local pharmacy under an alias, claiming that it was for killing rats. She then took the poison home and put it into the food served to her husband Rade, who soon after began vomiting violently and died. His death was not regarded as suspicious, and Milka inherited his estate, since the couple had no children.[1] Over the next few months, dozens of other relatives and their servants were poisoned in the same fashion, mainly the Jagodi\u0107 household. As a result, four people were admitted to a clinic in Zagreb with complaints of terrible cramps in their stomachs: the widow Slavka Jagodi\u0107, her daughter Sava, an unnamed servant and a close relative of the family. Shortly after their admission, all of the victims died.[2] The nine other living members of the Jagodi\u0107 family survived, but were left with the after effects of the poisoning. However, on 2 July that year, another strange death occurred: the family's Romani blacksmith, Miso Gjurgjevi\u0107, died writhing in agony, much alike the others before him. This arose suspicions from local villagers, who were quick to point out a possible culprit: the widow Milka Pavlovi\u0107, whose husband had passed in eerily similar circumstances just months before. Milka was arrested, and the prosecutor's office ordered that all of the deceased be exhumed and tested for traces of arsenic poisoning.[2] While she protested her innocence at first, Pavlovi\u0107 eventually admitted that she had poisoned her victims because of her desire to acquire their wealth, a statement backed up when the autopsies concluded that Rade Pavlovi\u0107, the Jagodi\u0107 family members and Miso Gjurgjevi\u0107 had been poisoned with lethal quantities of arsenic. According to Milka, she poured the poison into biscuits, salt and any other food while she was alone cooking in the kitchen, and thereafter served it to her unaware victims.[1]\n\nAfter a six-day long trial, Milka Pavlovi\u0107 was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death.[3] During her trial, it was additionally revealed that she had planned to dispose of a two-year-old child, the heir to an inheritance, with a poisoned loaf, but was stopped in the nick of time by the child's mother. For her crimes, she was brought to Bjelovar, where she was executed by hanging on May 18, 1935.[1]"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about blockchain technology for me, in laymans terms? \"Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.  \n\nA simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent.\n\nOf course, blockchain is more complicated than a Google Doc, but the analogy is apt because it illustrates three critical ideas of the technology: Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.\n\nBlocks\nEvery chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements:\n\nThe data in the block.\nA 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash. \nThe hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).\nWhen the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.  \n\nMiners\nMiners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.\n\nIn a blockchain every block has its own unique nonce and hash, but also references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block isn't easy, especially on large chains.\n\nMiners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible nonce-hash combinations that must be mined before the right one is found. When that happens miners are said to have found the \"golden nonce\" and their block is added to the chain. \n\nMaking a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after. This is why it's extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. Think of it as \"safety in math\" since finding golden nonces requires an enormous amount of time and computing power.\n\nWhen a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.\n\nBEST BLOCKCHAIN COMPANIES WITH OPEN JOBS\nTop Blockchain Companies Hiring Now\n\nNodes\nOne of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning. \n\nEvery node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent, every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each participant is given a unique alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.\n\nCombining public information with a system of checks-and-balances helps the blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users. Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of trust via technology. Cryptocurrencies: The Beginning of Blockchain's Technological Rise\nBlockchain\u2019s most well-known use (and maybe most controversial) is in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies (or tokens), like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, that can be used to buy goods and services. Just like a digital form of cash, crypto can be used to buy everything from your lunch to your next home. Unlike cash, crypto uses blockchain to act as both a public ledger and an enhanced cryptographic security system, so online transactions are always recorded and secured. To date, there are roughly 6,700 cryptocurrencies in the world that have a total market cap around $1.6 trillion, with Bitcoin holding a majority of the value. These tokens have become incredibly popular over the last few years, with one Bitcoin equaling $60,000. Here are some of the main reasons why everyone is suddenly taking notice of cryptocurrencies:\n\nBlockchain\u2019s security makes theft much harder since each cryptocurrency has its own irrefutable identifiable number that is attached to one owner.\nCrypto reduces the need for individualized currencies and central banks- With blockchain, crypto can be sent to anywhere and anyone in the world without the need for currency exchanging or without interference from central banks.\nCryptocurrencies can make some people rich- Speculators have been driving up the price of crypto, especially Bitcoin, helping some early adopters to become billionaires. Whether this is actually a positive has yet to be seen, as some retractors believe that speculators do not have the long-term benefits of crypto in mind.\nMore and more large corporations are coming around to the idea of a blockchain-based digital currency for payments. In February 2021, Tesla famously announced that it would invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and accept it as payment for their cars.\nOf course, there are many legitimate arguments against blockchain-based digital currencies. First, crypto isn\u2019t a very regulated market. Many governments were quick to jump into crypto, but few have a staunch set of codified laws regarding it. Additionally, crypto is incredibly volatile due to those aforementioned speculators. In 2016, Bitcoin was priced around $450 per token. It then jumped to about $16,000 a token in 2018, dipped to around $3,100, then has since increased to more than $60,000. Lack of stability has caused some people to get very rich, while a majority have still lost thousands. \n\nWhether or not digital currencies are the future remains to be seen. For now, it seems as if blockchain\u2019s meteoric rise is more starting to take root in reality than pure hype. Though it\u2019s still making headway in this entirely-new, highly-exploratory field, blockchain is also showing promise beyond Bitcoin.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentence:\n\nCyprus\u2019 graffiti paints a rich and complex picture of a society divided\nStreet art in Cyprus does more than attract tourists \u2013 it tells the story of the country\u2019s rich, and complicated, history \n\nAll too often, graffiti is categorised as either art or vandalism, when in fact it\u2019s so much more than that. When read with special attention, graffiti can offer deep insights into societies experiencing rapid social and political change \u2013 especially those marred by recent conflict.\n\nThe walls of a city give communities and individuals who may not have a formal platform space to share their feelings and opinions, and challenge dominant beliefs or ideals.\n\nAs researchers interested in societies recovering from disaster or conflict, we recently took a trip to explore graffiti in Cyprus. Cyprus and its capital, Nicosia, have remained divided since 1974, following the Turkish invasion and ensuing conflict.\n\nThe Turkish-Cypriot state in the north (recognised only by Turkey) is separated from the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus in the south by a UN-controlled buffer zone.\n\nCrossings between the two sides are only permitted through closely monitored checkpoints, leaving the Cypriot people physically, politically and culturally divided.\n\nIn places like this, graffiti can both reflect and shape community attitudes at a grassroots level. By seriously examining graffiti as a cultural product of such societies, we can better understand these divisions and work towards peacebuilding.\n\nThe power of graffiti\n\nGraffiti encompasses a wide variety of motivations and styles: anything from tagging to more artistic forms of expression like murals. Research has investigated how graffiti can be a channel for political participation and informal education. It\u2019s a medium widely associated with urban subcultures formed around punk, hip-hop and skateboarding along with many other social movements over the decades.\n\nViews about the value of graffiti can vary just as widely. Authorities, artists and members of the public tend to take different stances, which can also depend on context, content and style. Graffiti has sometimes been linked to social disorder and decline, but it can also add cultural value or in some cases lead to \u201cartwashing\u201d and gentrification. Certainly, it has the power to influence the character of a place, and change urban landscapes over time.\n\nWhen searching for meaning in graffiti, we must look at its form and content. For example, pieces of plain writing may initially seem quite simple, but things like language choices can be telling.\n\nIn Nicosia, Turkish and Greek messages were painted with meaning for each respective \u201cinside\u201d group, while English was used to address a wider, international audience. So language choice is indirectly related to the ethno-nationalist conflict, and acts as an informal commentary on people\u2019s experiences of the city.\n\nInevitably, we saw many references to division and conflict in the graffiti of Nicosia. But we also saw pieces related to local gang tags, local politics, anti-sexism and the patriarchy, racism, migrant worker rights, refugees, consumerism, veganism and LGBT+ inclusion \u2013 among other topics.\n\nThis suggests local people are seeing beyond the past conflict in their daily lives. But it also suggests existing formal platforms for these issues to be addressed may not be effective or leave some feeling disillusioned. So people turn to city walls.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nLarger scale murals across Cyprus are beautifully and skilfully painted \u2013 and equally interesting. In war-torn, damaged urban landscapes, they can be seen as an attempt to make the spaces more aesthetically appealing or to make a larger statement. These are often commissioned, and are even incorporated into official peacebuilding initiatives, art festivals and tourism strategies.\n\nA mural in the southern city of Limassol, depicting a Nepali woman and her child, was painted shortly after the 2015 earthquake; unrelated to the Cypriot conflict itself, it affirms that Cypriot artists are outward-looking and aware of turmoil beyond their own borders (not always common in conflict zones).\n\nSymbols are commonly used in street art across the world to deliver powerful political statements instantly. Internationally recognised symbols make a visual connection to transnational communities, ideologies and movements.\n\nIn Nicosia, common symbols included the Communist hammer and sickle, the Anarchist symbol, the peace sign, doves, gender signs and even swastikas. These symbols have broad, universal meanings attached to them so that no matter where the audience is from (Cyprus receives more than 3m tourists per year), the message is understood.\n\nLocation matters\n\nWhere graffiti is painted also tells a significant story: we saw that location influenced both the amount and the content of graffiti. The old city of Nicosia has lots of buffer zone walls and barriers, and a border crossing on the main shopping thoroughfare.\n\nThe areas closest to crossings contained mostly English language messages, explicitly about the conflict. Further away from the buffer zone, we observed less graffiti, and the messages become more varied.\n\nWe can speculate, then, that the division might have a greater influence on daily life, the closer people are to the dividing wall. This highly contextual insight has the potential to enhance our understanding of the unique experiences of local people in conflict-affected zones.\n\nOur early investigations of graffiti have already told us much about life in conflict-affected Cyprus. Clearly, the importance of graffiti should not be overlooked: it can open a window into the lives and minds of many people, who might otherwise lack a voice."}

{"prompt": "Can you help me summarize this article on Milka Pavlovi\u0107 in 7 bullet points or less?\n\nMilka Pavlovi\u0107 (1905 \u2013 18 May 1935) was a Croatian serial killer. A peasant woman living in Stari Pavljani, near Bjelovar, she poisoned family members, relatives and servants with arsenic between March and July 1934, succeeding in killing six and wounding ten others so she could acquire their inheritance. After being convicted of the crimes, she was sentenced to death and subsequently executed.[1]\n\nBiography\nLittle documentation of Pavlovi\u0107's early life exists. She was born in 1905 in the small of village of Kokinac, and at some point, she married Rade Pavlovi\u0107 of nearby Stari Pavljani, moving into his home and finding work as a milkmaid. A childless, bitter woman, Milka was regarded poorly by her fellow villagers.[2]\n\nAround March 1934, she bought arsenic from a local pharmacy under an alias, claiming that it was for killing rats. She then took the poison home and put it into the food served to her husband Rade, who soon after began vomiting violently and died. His death was not regarded as suspicious, and Milka inherited his estate, since the couple had no children.[1] Over the next few months, dozens of other relatives and their servants were poisoned in the same fashion, mainly the Jagodi\u0107 household. As a result, four people were admitted to a clinic in Zagreb with complaints of terrible cramps in their stomachs: the widow Slavka Jagodi\u0107, her daughter Sava, an unnamed servant and a close relative of the family. Shortly after their admission, all of the victims died.[2] The nine other living members of the Jagodi\u0107 family survived, but were left with the after effects of the poisoning. However, on 2 July that year, another strange death occurred: the family's Romani blacksmith, Miso Gjurgjevi\u0107, died writhing in agony, much alike the others before him. This arose suspicions from local villagers, who were quick to point out a possible culprit: the widow Milka Pavlovi\u0107, whose husband had passed in eerily similar circumstances just months before. Milka was arrested, and the prosecutor's office ordered that all of the deceased be exhumed and tested for traces of arsenic poisoning.[2] While she protested her innocence at first, Pavlovi\u0107 eventually admitted that she had poisoned her victims because of her desire to acquire their wealth, a statement backed up when the autopsies concluded that Rade Pavlovi\u0107, the Jagodi\u0107 family members and Miso Gjurgjevi\u0107 had been poisoned with lethal quantities of arsenic. According to Milka, she poured the poison into biscuits, salt and any other food while she was alone cooking in the kitchen, and thereafter served it to her unaware victims.[1]\n\nAfter a six-day long trial, Milka Pavlovi\u0107 was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death.[3] During her trial, it was additionally revealed that she had planned to dispose of a two-year-old child, the heir to an inheritance, with a poisoned loaf, but was stopped in the nick of time by the child's mother. For her crimes, she was brought to Bjelovar, where she was executed by hanging on May 18, 1935.[1]"}

(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella)\u00a9 Christopher Polk INDIO, CA - APRIL 13: General view of the atmosphere during day 2 of the 2013 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club on April 13, 2013 in Indio, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella)\nIn the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions as the country recovers from the Omicron variant spike. Naturally, that\u2019s led people to wonder how upcoming music festivals will handle virus protocol. This week, Goldenvoice, the company that oversees Coachella, caused some jaws to hit the floor by announcing that there will be no mask, testing, or vaccine requirements at this year\u2019s festival, which will take place the weekends of April 15th and April 22nd.\n\nCoachella is the earliest high profile American festival each year, if not the most high profile American festival, period. In both 2020 and 2021, the festival organizers attempted to push back the shows several months, but wound up canceling them outright due to the persistence of COVID. The 2022 iteration is set to feature Ye (fka Kanye West), Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Lil Baby, and dozens of other artists. Many of those featured, including Eilish, Vince Staples, Peggy Gou, Megan Thee Stallion, and Maggie Rogers have publicly advocated for getting vaccinated.\n\nThe \u201cHealth & Safety Rules\u201d section of the Coachella website says the lack of vaccination, testing, or mask requirements are \u201cin accordance with local guidelines,\u201d but notes that the exact rules \u201cmay change at any time as determined by federal, state or local government agencies or instrumentalities, artists or the promoter,\u201d and that it\u2019s possible any of those safety measures could be reinstated. (The webpage also notes that \u201c...there is no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to COVID-19.\u201d)\n\nCalifornia has been gradually easing its restrictions, including dropping the mask mandate for vaccinated individuals indoors on February 16 (though a new bill being discussed could create a vaccine mandate at all workplaces if it is put into effect). Meanwhile, Governor Gavin Newsome is in the process of rolling out his future plan for pandemic management.\n\nA few other festivals have already announced plans for 2022, or alluded to those plans. New York City\u2019s Governors Ball, which takes place in mid-June, will require proof of full vaccination or a negative test within 72 hours of each festival day, though that may change. Tennessee\u2019s Bonnaroo has not yet made its specific COVID policies clear, but says \u201cpreventative health measures...may be required for this show.\u201d (Last year\u2019s festival explicitly required proof of vaccination or a negative test.) Smaller festivals like Detroit\u2019s Mo Pop state that the COVID-related rules \u201cmay change at any time\u201d based on what the government, promoter, or artists decree. (Last year, artists like Jason Isbell and The Killers put their own vaccination and testing requirements into place for live shows.)\n\nOn the other hand, the Stagecoach festival, which is also presented by Goldenvoice, will have similarly lax COVID rules. It\u2019s set to take place April 29-May 1, and uses the same Indio, CA grounds as Coachella.\n\nWhen music festivals resumed in 2021, there was concern that packing large crowds of people in tight (albeit outdoor) spaces could lead to the spread of the virus. Per Rolling Stone, music festivals last summer in Michigan and Oregon which did not require vaccination were connected to outbreaks in their respective host cities. This increased the scrutiny on major festivals like Lollapalooza, which returned in late July 2021 and required attendees to either show vaccine cards or a negative COVID test within the last 72 hours. A little over 200 attendees of the Chicago fest did contract COVID-19, including 127 who were vaccinated, but the city\u2019s public health commissioner did not deem it a \u201c\u2018super-spreader\u2019 event.\u201d\n\nThe global concert industry lost over $30 billion in 2020, so it\u2019s easy to see why festivals like Coachella are pushing to have as few restrictions as possible. Still, the ever-changing nature of the pandemic makes projecting even a few months into the future feel like a fool\u2019s errand. According to The New York Times, COVID cases in California are down 69 percent over the last two weeks, but the state is still averaging over 20,000 new cases per 7 days."}

Any Android app that is available even if it is not on the Google Play store can be downloaded and installed on an Android device.\n\nThis is not the case with iOS. Case in point: Apple will not allow you to view Flash videos and play Flash games on iOS devices for reasons only known to them.\n\nBecause Apple maintains such as tight grip on the applications that can be allowed on an iOS device, the devices are more secure.\n\nOn the other hand, the openness of the Android platform means that there is a bigger risk of not just malware but other security threats. This makes iOS devices a safer option for those who want a more secure device.\n\nApple takes the time to ensure that the interface is pleasant and well designed. Across all iOS devices you expect to find well designed products and Apple doesn't disappoint. But when it comes to being able to customize how the widgets will appear, Android devices offer you better control.\n\nAlso there is such a wide range of different Android devices that to change the interface you just need to select a different Android device.\n\nOn the other hand, Android devices have a considerably less battery life but again, there are so many different devices, meaning you can choose one with a better battery life.\n\nUsually iOS devices have better battery life as compared to Android devices.

The deal makes Rodgers the highest-paid player in NFL history on an annual basis while also reducing his salary-cap number for 2022.\n\nThe latter detail is especially important to Green Bay's chances of victory in the upcoming season. Green Bay was over the cap by roughly $26 million, and Rodgers' existing deal accounted for a cap number of $46.6 million in 2022, making retaining receiver Davante Adams quite a challenge. With Rodgers' new, lower cap number now factored in, Green Bay can place the franchise tag on Adams before Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline, which Rapoport reported is what the Packers are expected to do.\n\nPat McAfee of \"The Pat McAfee Show\" first reported the news of Rodgers' deal. The QB later confirmed via Twitter that he \"will be playing for the Packers\" this upcoming season and is \"very excited to be back.\"\""}

His first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician \u201canalyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal\u201d.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as \u201cmysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition\u201d.\n\nCombined with nearly 150 \u201ccarefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs\u201d, the collection \u201cresembles an epic poem\u201d, said S&S.\n\nJonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: \u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.\u201d\n\nDylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016. His latest album, 2020\u2019s Rough and Rowdy Ways, received mass critical acclaim and was placed highly in many publications\u2019 end-of-year lists.\n\nIn January, he sold his entire recorded catalogue to Sony Music Entertainment, following the sale in 2020 of his publishing catalogue to Universal Music.\n\nDylan is currently fighting a lawsuit that alleges he groomed and sexually abused a woman, referred to as JC, when she was 12 years old. His legal team have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit \u201ca brazen shakedown ... false, malicious, reckless and defamatory\u201d.\n\nThe Philosophy of Modern Song is published on 8 November , with an accompanying audiobook partially narrated by Dylan."}

{"prompt": "What the thesis statement of this article?\n\nHas The Word \u201cExpert\u201d Lost Its Meaning?\nby Ashley Austrew\nPublished February 1, 2019\n\nWhat makes someone an expert? In the days of the internet, it seems like it\u2019s gotten much harder to tell.\n\nSocial media and the instant expert\n\nSocial media makes it possible for anyone to have a platform, giving rise to the phenomenon known as the instant expert. These self-appointed authorities on everything from federal policy to last night\u2019s episode of This Is Us can hop on Twitter and share their hot takes in a multi-Tweet thread in the time it takes most people to make a sandwich.\n\nIf it\u2019s a title almost anyone can claim, has the meaning of the word changed?\n\nWhat did expert use to mean?\n\nThe word expert has been in use since the 1300s ... long before social media was a thing.\n\nIt comes from the Latin expertus, meaning \u201cto try\u201d or \u201cexperience.\u201d But in modern times, expert applies specifically to \u201ca person who has special skills or knowledge in a particular field.\u201d An expert is typically someone who specializes in a subject to the extent that they are considered an authority. They\u2019re someone who can engage with a subject from multiple angles and who has developed their knowledge over time through a combination of research and experience. That cultivation takes time, lots of time, to develop.\n\nBut when the internet came along, it changed how we think about expertise. Now, anyone can give their opinion on an issue (and go viral for it); anyone can start a website or post a review of a movie, restaurant, or product. That transparency has been a good thing in the sense that it\u2019s given more people a voice, even some legitimate experts who were being crowded out of the arena. But it also poses the risk that the voices of actual, legitimate experts sometimes get crowded out instead.\n\nWhy does everyone think they\u2019re an expert now?\n\nAn article on Glassdoor.com promises to teach anyone how to become an expert in digital media. \n\nStep one? \u201cFind something you\u2019re passionate about, and start blogging about it.\u201d \n\nSupposing someone follows the steps laid out in that piece, does additional reading, or maybe even takes an online course in SEO, are they then qualified to, say, weigh in on the recent layoffs of more than 1,000 journalists by HuffPost, Buzzfeed, Gannett, and Verizon media?\n\nIt\u2019d be elitist to say that all experts must have formal education and decades of experience. Not everyone has the privilege of being able to afford a university education, has special training, or has even been alive long enough to have had a decades-long career, and that doesn\u2019t make their experience or knowledge less valid. There are real self-made experts who revolutionize their fields. It\u2019s just that the internet and its armchair experts don\u2019t always make it easy for people to know which voices can and should be trusted.\n\nAre armchair experts a bad thing, though?\n\nThe internet has created a platform for the so-called armchair expert. This phrase describes \u201csomeone who asserts their knowledge of a subject without having a real understanding of it.\u201d \n\nNeed an example? When the trailer dropped for the Ted Bundy movie, Extremely Wicked, Shocking, Evil and Vile, it launched a huge debate on social media about how the director chose to portray Bundy.\n\nMajor news sources quickly picked up the story that the biopic had been accused of glamorizing a serial killer, which caught the attention of even more people. Now, a quick search of \u201cTed Bundy trailer\u201d on Twitter yields a complex conversation about character development, film making, the portrayal of criminals by the media, and how to cut a movie trailer properly. And it\u2019s average people, not experts, who do most of the talking.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, though. In fact, the actor Dax Shepard has actually found a unique way to capitalize on conversations between non-expert individuals that can often yield truly complex and meaningful results. He hosts a hit podcast called Armchair Expert, where he interviews celebrity guests about their own careers, personal struggles, and unique life experiences. \u201cI will attempt to discover human \u2018truths\u2019 without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection,\u201d he says of the podcast\u2019s premise. \u201cI will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.\u201d\n\nAnd, armchair experts are just that: Experts who dole out the sort of information one can develop sitting in their own armchairs.\n\nThe underlying problem is misinformation\n\nThe problem comes when the exchange of ideas spreads misinformation that is not challenged because \u201canyone can be an expert.\u201d As Washington state battled a huge measles outbreak at the end of January 2019, the anti-vaccination experts are out in force, including Larry Cook, a California naturopath who used the outbreak as an opportunity to fundraise to spread his anti-vaccine message to more parents.\n\nThe doctors and health officials promoting vaccination have extensive knowledge and experience in the medical field. Many of the people who are speaking out against vaccines do not. And yet, someone like Cook has over 21,000 followers on Facebook, many of whom are spreading his beliefs as fact.\n\nIn many ways, our expanding ideas about expertise have led to meaningful thought and discussion on a previously unimagined scale before the internet or social media. \n\nBut with large platforms comes great responsibility. And the knowledge that almost anyone can claim authority on a given subject should encourage us to think critically and often about what it really means to be an expert. \n\nMaybe we all have to step up to become experts in weeding through the infinite information now at our fingertips."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about blockchain technology for me, in laymans terms? \"Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.  \n\nA simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent.\n\nOf course, blockchain is more complicated than a Google Doc, but the analogy is apt because it illustrates three critical ideas of the technology: Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.\n\nBlocks\nEvery chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements:\n\nThe data in the block.\nA 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash. \nThe hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).\nWhen the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.  \n\nMiners\nMiners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.\n\nIn a blockchain every block has its own unique nonce and hash, but also references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block isn't easy, especially on large chains.\n\nMiners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible nonce-hash combinations that must be mined before the right one is found. When that happens miners are said to have found the \"golden nonce\" and their block is added to the chain. \n\nMaking a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after. This is why it's extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. Think of it as \"safety in math\" since finding golden nonces requires an enormous amount of time and computing power.\n\nWhen a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.\n\nBEST BLOCKCHAIN COMPANIES WITH OPEN JOBS\nTop Blockchain Companies Hiring Now\n\nNodes\nOne of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning. \n\nEvery node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent, every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each participant is given a unique alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.\n\nCombining public information with a system of checks-and-balances helps the blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users. Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of trust via technology. Cryptocurrencies: The Beginning of Blockchain's Technological Rise\nBlockchain\u2019s most well-known use (and maybe most controversial) is in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies (or tokens), like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, that can be used to buy goods and services. Just like a digital form of cash, crypto can be used to buy everything from your lunch to your next home. Unlike cash, crypto uses blockchain to act as both a public ledger and an enhanced cryptographic security system, so online transactions are always recorded and secured. To date, there are roughly 6,700 cryptocurrencies in the world that have a total market cap around $1.6 trillion, with Bitcoin holding a majority of the value. These tokens have become incredibly popular over the last few years, with one Bitcoin equaling $60,000. Here are some of the main reasons why everyone is suddenly taking notice of cryptocurrencies:\n\nBlockchain\u2019s security makes theft much harder since each cryptocurrency has its own irrefutable identifiable number that is attached to one owner.\nCrypto reduces the need for individualized currencies and central banks- With blockchain, crypto can be sent to anywhere and anyone in the world without the need for currency exchanging or without interference from central banks.\nCryptocurrencies can make some people rich- Speculators have been driving up the price of crypto, especially Bitcoin, helping some early adopters to become billionaires. Whether this is actually a positive has yet to be seen, as some retractors believe that speculators do not have the long-term benefits of crypto in mind.\nMore and more large corporations are coming around to the idea of a blockchain-based digital currency for payments. In February 2021, Tesla famously announced that it would invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and accept it as payment for their cars.\nOf course, there are many legitimate arguments against blockchain-based digital currencies. First, crypto isn\u2019t a very regulated market. Many governments were quick to jump into crypto, but few have a staunch set of codified laws regarding it. Additionally, crypto is incredibly volatile due to those aforementioned speculators. In 2016, Bitcoin was priced around $450 per token. It then jumped to about $16,000 a token in 2018, dipped to around $3,100, then has since increased to more than $60,000. Lack of stability has caused some people to get very rich, while a majority have still lost thousands. \n\nWhether or not digital currencies are the future remains to be seen. For now, it seems as if blockchain\u2019s meteoric rise is more starting to take root in reality than pure hype. Though it\u2019s still making headway in this entirely-new, highly-exploratory field, blockchain is also showing promise beyond Bitcoin.\""}

I don't have the attention span to read it all. \"Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, and are holding staff hostage, according to Ukranian officials.\n\nTroops overran the plant on the first day of Russia\u2019s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine, a spokesperson for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, Yevgeniya Kuznetsov\u0430, told CNN.\n\nAlyona Shevtsova, advisor to the commander of Ukraine\u2019s Ground Forces, said on Facebook that Russian forces have taken control of the power station and that the staff are being \u201cheld hostage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chornobyl zone was lost after a \u201cfierce battle.\u201d\n\nPodolyak said the condition of the former Chernobyl power plant\u2019s nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.\n\n\u201cAfter a completely senseless Russian attack in this direction, it is impossible to say that Chernobyl is safe,\u201d Podolyak added. \u201cThis is one of the most serious threats to Europe today.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Thursday said it was outraged over \u201ccredible reports\u201d that Russian soldiers are holding staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage.\n\n\u201cThis unlawful and dangerous hostage taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in a Thursday evening briefing.\n\n\u201cWe condemn it and we request their release.\u201d Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russian forces were attempting to wrest control of the nuclear plant.\n\nWarnings over Russian moves\n\u201cRussian occupation forces are trying to seize the Chernobyl (nuclear power plant). Our defenders are sacrificing their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,\u201d Zelensky tweeted.\u201dThis is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry echoed the President\u2019s warning, raising the specter of another nuclear disaster in the city.\n\n\u201cIn 1986, the world saw the biggest technological disaster in Chernobyl,\u201d the ministry tweeted. \u201cIf Russia continues the war, Chernobyl can happen again in 2022.\u201d More than 30 people died in the immediate aftermath of an explosion that tore through Chernobyl\u2019s No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, near Pripyat, Ukraine. In the years that followed, countless others died from radiation symptoms, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization. The Ukraine government evacuated some 135,000 people from the area and the 19-mile exclusion zone around the plant will remain uninhabitable for decades.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv  on February 24, 2022. - Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a \"full-scale invasion\" was underway. \nIn the months after the accident, a sarcophagus was built to cover Reactor 4 and contain the radioactive material. However, it has since deteriorated, resulting in radiation leaks.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine before dawn Thursday with a series of missile attacks against locations near the capital Kyiv, as well as long-range artillery against the city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border. The assault quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine as Russian forces attacked the country from three sides."}

{"prompt": "Please can you summarize the article below into three concise sentences?\n\nThe Marvellous Neil Baldwin is back to make us feel better\n\nNeil Baldwin was taken to the nation's hearts thanks to the Bafta-winning BBC film Marvellous, in which he was played by Toby Jones. He has now helped create a theatre version.\n\nPeople who get their life stories turned into films and plays are usually celebrities or politicians or those who have done something particularly heroic or remarkable. On the face of it, Neil Baldwin is an unlikely subject.\n\nHe's a former clown and Stoke City kit man who wasn't well-known - at least beyond his Staffordshire home town - and hasn't been at the centre of any daring or dramatic historical events.\n\nBut viewers who watched the heartwarming Marvellous in 2014 came to realise he is remarkable and heroic in his own way.\n\nThey saw his uncanny ability to spread positivity and endear himself to everybody he meets, from students to archbishops to footballers.\n\nThey also saw how he always manages to get what he wants and keep going in the face of adversity, his learning difficulties anything but an obstacle.\n\n\"When I saw it, I thought, that's a good film,\" he says now. \"The best film ever made. And I still think it is.\"\n\nMarvellous won three Baftas in 2015 including best single drama, and was also showered with prizes from the Royal Television Society, Broadcasting Press Guild and Monte Carlo TV Festival.\n\nSince then, Baldwin has received other honours including the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent and the British Empire Medal for services to the community in Newcastle-under-Lyme.\n\nHe now wears that medal everywhere, and has it pinned to the lapel of his jacket when he comes to Newcastle-under-Lyme's New Vic theatre to discuss the stage adaptation.\n\nHe has created the show with the venue's artistic director Theresa Heskins, and it is finally reaching the stage after lengthy pandemic-enforced delays.\n\n\"Three times it was postponed because of the pandemic,\" says Heskins, who has joined Baldwin in the theatre's lounge during a break from rehearsals.\n\nShe says to him: \"Every time I phoned you, I thought, how am I going to tell Neil?\n\n\"He made me feel better every single time. I'd phone him up feeling dreadful about it, and then I'd put the phone down feeling so much better - which is Neil's special power.\"\n\nThe play will have its official opening night on Baldwin's 76th birthday, on Tuesday.\n\nFormer Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams recently conducted a special service in Baldwin's honour to mark his 62 years on campus at Keele University, where his mother worked as a cleaner and where the young Baldwin made himself a popular presence and unofficial mascot.\n\nA far back as 1968, he was granted honorary life membership of the students' union, and he received an honorary degree in 2013.\n\nHis love of making people laugh led him to join the circus as Nello the clown in 1980. His other passions include Stoke City FC, and when he introduced himself to new manager Lou Macari in 1991, Macari decided Baldwin would be a force for good in the dressing room.\n\nHe made Baldwin the kit man and described him as \"my best-ever signing\".\n\n\"His real value was in helping the players relax before games,\" Macari wrote in his autobiography. \"No chemist ever produced a drug that could reduce stress levels like Nello. I was convinced that this gave us an edge in matches. Nello bonded the group.\"\n\nBaldwin has even run his own football club, named Neil Baldwin FC, at Keele University since 1967, asking the likes of Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker to serve stints as its president. They agreed, of course.\n\nBaldwin published his autobiography in 2015 and when they started work on the play, he and Heskins went through his life story with a set of actors.\n\n\"We'd say to Neil, 'There's this bit in the autobiography, could you tell us a little bit more about that?\" Heskins explains.\n\n\"He'd tell us, then we'd try to re-stage that. While the actors were improvising, Neil would say, 'I think I did that and I said that.' And then we'd do those things.\"\n\nShe adds, addressing Baldwin: \"Always, whenever we wanted to get a bit serious, you'd be the person that would always be telling us, 'Wouldn't it be funny if she had itching powder in her skirt now?'\"\n\nThe world could do with more of Neil Baldwin's spirit-lifting powers. So what is his secret of staying upbeat?\n\n\"I just stay positive,\" he replies simply, before recalling a conversation with a young friend whose mother had recently died.\n\n\"He rung me up on Christmas Day and said, 'Why do you keep on being happy?' I said, 'Life is very short sometimes and you've got to keep happy.'\"\n\nHeskins has tried to dig deeper. \"Remember that time I trapped you in the auditorium for two hours?\" she says to him. \"I wouldn't let you out until you answered exactly that question. What is your recipe for happiness?\n\n\"You kept saying to me, 'Just be happy.' And I kept saying, 'What if some people can't? Offer me some concrete ideas.'\n\n\"You said, 'Get a pet. Sing. Have friends.' You said to me, 'I know I live on my own, but I've got that many friends.' And you said, 'That's one of the keys to being happy, having people.'\n\n\"You have all those friends and you are lovely to them. You make people feel good about themselves by being so kind to them, and that makes people happy. That feels like your amazing recipe for happiness. And also laughing.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Baldwin says. \"I always do try to keep laughing. Sometimes people do get upset. But you've always got life to live.\"\n\nRoyal approval\nBaldwin's trademark positivity was justified when it came to making Marvellous. \"Before the film ever came out, I said, 'We're going to London to the Baftas.' [Writer] Peter Bowker says, 'Don't be a fool.' I said, 'You'll be the fool if we win.' And we won.\"\n\nThat film opened doors for Baldwin to make even more friends in high places. A devout royalist, he recounts a visit to Buckingham Palace, one of his proudest days.\n\n\"William and Kate were there and William said to me, 'You've won a Bafta haven't you? What a film that was.'\n\n\"And I said to Kate, 'What lovely children you've got.' She said, 'Thank you, sir.' I turned around and said, 'I'm not a sir till you make me one!'\"\n\nMarvellous made Baldwin something approaching a national treasure, and there's still room for more gongs on his lapel."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the Federal Reserve nominee?\n\nSarah Bloom Raskin has withdrawn as President Joe Biden\u2019s pick to be the Federal Reserve\u2019s top Wall Street watchdog, ending a standoff over the president\u2019s slate of central bank nominees.\n\nBiden, in a statement Tuesday on her withdrawal, said Raskin \u201cwas subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups.\u201d\n\nRaskin, whom the president tapped to be the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision, has been stuck in the Senate Banking Committee amid a GOP boycott of a vote on her nomination, effectively blocking her confirmation from advancing to the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and moderate Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said Monday they would not support Raskin\u2019s nomination, all but dooming her chances of confirmation. Raskin\u2019s withdrawal was first reported by the New Yorker.\n\nRaskin, a former Fed governor and deputy Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, had been confirmed twice before for those posts with no opposition from Republicans. But she faced blowback this time from GOP lawmakers and Manchin over her calls for regulators to more closely scrutinize bank lending to oil and gas companies and help mitigate climate-related risks to the financial system.\n\n\u201cTheir point of contention was my frank public discussion of climate change and the economic costs associated with it,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Biden, according to the New Yorker. \u201cIt was \u2013 and is \u2013 my considered view that the perils of climate change must be added to the list of serious risks that the Federal Reserve considers as it works to ensure the stability and resiliency of our economy and financial system.\u201d\n\nWhile the financial industry raised no public objections to Raskin\u2019s nomination, Republicans such as Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania expressed fear that she might pursue measures that would make it more expensive for banks to lend to oil companies. She once wrote that regulators should \u201cask themselves how their existing instruments can be used to incentivize a rapid, orderly, and just transition away from high-emission and biodiversity-destroying investments.\u201d"}

In Portuguese, the zoo noted, Fofo means cute.\n\nPorcupines, perhaps as much as any creature, show the variety of forms allowed to animals. Many of us may know porcupines for their sharp quills, and so view them as prickly sorts.\n\nBut a March 4 zoo report on Fofo suggested an animal\u2019s personality may not reflect its structure. Fofo, the zoo said, is calm, gentle and good-natured \u2014 almost as if his conduct is guided by character rather than quills.\n\nThe birth process of these porcupines also seems to show nature\u2019s creativity. At birth, the zoo said, the quills are soft. They harden only after exposure to air."}

But before you do that, you need to be able to entice people to sign up, namely, give them a reason to want to give you their email address.\n\nNaturally, people won\u2019t provide you with their email addresses for nothing. So, creating a simple email signup form saying \u201cSign up to our email list to receive our latest great content\u201d will probably see low conversion rates.\n\nOne of the best ways to capture someone\u2019s email is to create a lead magnet that entices them to sign up.

NASA's Launch Services Program is managing the liftoff of GOES-T, but the satellite will be operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) once it's aloft. \n\nGOES-T is the third spacecraft in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-R Series, which NOAA officials describe as \"the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most sophisticated weather-observing and environmental-monitoring system.\"\n\n\"The GOES-R Series provides advanced imagery and atmospheric measurements, real-time mapping of lightning activity and monitoring of space weather,\" NOAA officials wrote in a description of the program.\n\nGOES-T is destined for geostationary orbit, about 22,300 miles (35,900 kilometers) above Earth's surface. Once it gets there, the satellite will be renamed GOES-18. After mission managers finish checking out GOES-18's systems and scientific instruments, it will enter service as GOES-West, replacing the GOES-17 satellite in that role. GOES-17 will become an orbiting spare. (Yes, the nomenclature is very confusing.) \n\nGOES-18 will work together with GOES-16, which is currently serving as GOES-East, to \"watch over more than half the globe \u2014 from the west coast of Africa to New Zealand,\" NOAA officials wrote in a mission description."}

Glaucoma is increased pressure on your cat's eye caused by a failure of the eye's drainage system. The increased pressure can then lead to the destruction of the cat's retina and optic disk, where the optic nerve enters the eye.\n\nWhat causes glaucoma in cats?\nPrimary glaucoma is typically caused by a problem in how the eye has developed and is very rare in cats although sometimes seen in certain breeds including Siamese, Persian, and Burmese cats. This form of glaucoma usually begins in one eye, but it eventually involves both eyes and leads to complete blindness.\n\nSecondary glaucoma in cats is more common and typically due to uveitis, (which is inflammation inside the eye), or advanced cataracts, tumors, or retinal detachment.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of glaucoma in cats?\nIn spite of the fact that this condition is very painful, cats tend to be very good at hiding symptoms of glaucoma. Subtle signs of pain or illness include hiding, becoming less affectionate than normal and reduced grooming. Other signs of glaucoma in cats can include partially closed eye, pawing at eyes, watery discharge, obvious swelling or bulging of the eyeball, bloodshot eye, cloudiness of eye, dilated pupil or blindness.\n\nHow is glaucoma in cats diagnosed?\nFirst your vet will look for common symptoms of the condition, then to confirm a diagnosis of glaucoma your veterinary ophthamologist will measure the pressures of your cat's eyes, using a special piece of equipment called a Tonopen. \n\nCan glaucoma in cats be cured?\nSadly, cats are able to hide signs of pain very well, and the symptoms of glaucoma are often not picked up until the disease has progressed. By the time many cats see a vet they will have lost their eyesight permanently, and treatment will be focused on pain relief.\n\nThat said, when diagnosed early treatment may include a combination of surgery and medications to reduce eye pressures, preserve vision, and manage pain.\n\nEye Drops & Medications to Treat Glaucoma in Cats\nA number of different eye drops and pills are available to help decrease fluid production or increase fluid drainage from the eye. However they are not typically effective for controlling glaucoma in long term. These treatments are most often used to help prevent or delay the onset of glaucoma in the remaining eye, and as temporary treatment until surgery can be performed in the affected eye.\n\nSurgery to Treat Glaucoma in Cats\nWhile surgical treatments are available for glaucoma in cats, the type of surgery will depend on whether your cat still has the potential for vision.\n\nFor cat's with vision, a veterinary ophthamologist may be able to reduce the eye's pressure by performing a cycloablation procedure and a drainage implant procedure.\n\nIn cat's that have already lost their vision, your veterinary specialist may recommend the removal of eye in order to relieve the pain caused by glaucoma."}

A hero site generating better revenue for creators has sold out, say some musicians, while others hail the potential to reach new audiences. \n\nMusos and gamers were left scratching their heads last Wednesday as Bandcamp, the online record store hailed by independent artists as a bankable alternative to the razor-thin royalties of streaming, announced its acquisition by Epic Games, makers of the online gaming phenomenon Fortnite.\n\nBandcamp CEO Ethan Diamond framed the deal as a boon for artists, saying that the two US companies shared a vision of building \u201cthe most open, artist-friendly ecosystem in the world\u201d. A blogpost from Epic underlined the need for \u201cfair and open platforms\u201d to enable \u201ccreators to keep the majority of their hard-earned money\u201d.\n\nBut Bandcamp users reacted with shock and disappointment to the sale of the indie juggernaut, lamenting the loss of \u201cour\u201d store, as drummer and Spotify critic Damon Krukowski tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe all just got sold,\u201d lamented media theorist McKenzie Wark. Bemused gamers and tech experts, meanwhile, wondered what possible uses a company such as Epic \u2013 itself 40% owned by Chinese gaming megacorp Tencent \u2013 might have for the direct-to-fan marketplace for MP3s of niche musical genres like vaporwave and chiptune.\n\nSince its founding in 2008, Bandcamp has become a cornerstone of the global underground music economy through its \u201cpay-what-you-want\u201d download structure and low commissions, taking a 15% cut of every sale. During the pandemic, the San Francisco-based company earned kudos for waiving that fee on the first Friday of every month, generating millions of dollars for artists, as well as donating to racial justice campaigns including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nEpic has its own track record as a plucky indie, having remained largely in the hands of CEO Tim Sweeney since its founding in 1991. Like Bandcamp, Epic takes a relatively small cut from developers, setting its commission at 12% compared with Apple\u2019s 30%. Epic even took Apple to court \u2013 and lost, at great expense \u2013 to accuse the tech giant of monopolising the mobile gaming industry. But the company\u2019s fortunes have soared in recent years after the success of Fortnite and other free-to-play games. Now valued at $28bn, and facing its own controversies over data collection and Store exclusivity, it\u2019s no longer a feisty underdog.\n\nMany independent artists, already squeezed by the collapse of physical sales and \u2013 since Covid \u2013 a long hiatus from touring, see the Bandcamp sale as another disappointment in a long tradition of indie sellouts. But tech experts and neophyte musicians have also been speculating on the possibility of new integrations between Bandcamp\u2019s vast catalogue of music and Epic\u2019s cutting-edge game technology. These range from live-streaming events such as Fortnite\u2019s virtual concerts, which have seen artists Travis Scott and Marshmello putting on trippy performances for millions of emoting avatars, to social spaces such as Party Worlds, designed for virtual hangouts rather than combat and destruction.\n\nBeyond the busy world of Fortnite, Epic could also be thinking about easy routes into licensing music for software developers using Unreal Engine, the open and free-to-use development platform built by Epic\u2019s Sweeney. There are obvious opportunities for integration with Harmonix, the games studio behind Guitar Hero and Rock Band.\n\nMore importantly, Sweeney is a longtime proponent of virtual reality and its buzzy reincarnation as the metaverse, the promise of a virtual 3D environment built from interconnecting spaces and social networks. \u201cThe most plausible way the metaverse is going to rise,\u201d Sweeney said in 2020, \u201cisn\u2019t from one company, even Epic, building this thing and forcing everybody to use it. It\u2019s going to be from more and more companies and brands connecting their products and services.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, Epic\u2019s acquisition can also be read as a play for the hearts and minds of the next generation of musicians and music lovers who have grown up in virtual worlds such as Fortnite. Rather than attempting to convert digital natives into record-buying traditionalists, the smart move could be to meet Generation Z where they already are, among the 160 million players inside the Epic Games Store.\n\nSelling to Epic may also have presented itself as the least worst option for a company under pressure to provide returns for its early investors. Bandcamp received venture capital backing in its early years, and though the precise numbers involved are unknown, market logic dictates that VC-backed startups eventually start looking for an exit: either float on the stock market, which works for companies showing impressive growth and significant future valuation, or sell up.\n\nWhether or not that\u2019s the case for Bandcamp, it won\u2019t do much to cheer up the musicians and fans who long ago identified Silicon Valley economics as the source of their woes. On social media, the deal was met with cynicism by some of the musicians who make up Bandcamp\u2019s global community of creator-consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s VC-funded and has always been part of platform capitalism, where growth is paramount,\u201d wrote experimental artist Zola Jesus.\n\nThe irony is that Bandcamp has always positioned itself as a \u201ccommunity\u201d rather than a marketplace, yet that community has not been given a say in the fate of the value it has created. The solution, say some artists, is to take back control \u2013 either by moving over to a platform like Resonate, a streaming cooperative owned by its users, or exploring new Web3 protocols for collective ownership. Austin Robey, co-founder of alternative music platform Ampled, advocates for an \u201cexit to community\u201d, a model where startups are taken over by the users and stakeholders who depend on the product or service they\u2019ve created.\n\nStill, no other indie platform has yet achieved anything like the scale or appeal of Bandcamp, and the shift to alternative platforms will require a leap of technical literacy that most artists and fans aren\u2019t ready to make. In the short term, Bandcamp remains the slickest direct-to-fan operation in town \u2013 and is still paying out millions to artists.\n\n\u201cThe products and services you depend on aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d assured Diamond in his statement. Nothing will change in the short term, is the promise \u2013 although it\u2019s the same one that accompanies every similar acquisition. Those old enough to remember losing their MySpace music overnight may be feeling itchy. Word to the wise, advised one suspicious user, \u201cdownload all your Bandcamp MP3s if you haven\u2019t yet\u201d."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me? The title implies that if Russia cuts us off from oil, we might go to war with them. \"Russia faces the specter of a full-blown financial meltdown. Punishing sanctions leveled by the West have sent the ruble crashing to record lows, shuttered Moscow\u2019s stock market and made Russian assets toxic on the world stage.\n\nThe White House has even taken aim at Vladimir Putin\u2019s financial fortress, removing access to at least a chunk of Russia\u2019s $630 billion rainy-day fund that was designed to cushion the economic blow of this very crisis.\n\nNow comes the big question: How will Putin \u2014 who is also facing sanctions on his personal wealth from the West \u2014 fire back in what is rapidly morphing into economic warfare? There is growing concern that Putin could retaliate by using not just natural gas but also crude oil as a weapon against the West.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s energy supplies are very much at risk, either due to being withheld by Russia as a weapon or swiped off the market due to sanctions,\u201d Louise Dickson, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report Monday.\n\nThe worldwide supply of oil was already failing to keep up with demand. If Russia, the world\u2019s No. 2 oil producer, intentionally held back supply, it would likely send oil prices skyrocketing, dealing a painful blow to consumers around the world.\n\nJPMorgan has warned that oil would spike to $150 a barrel in the event that Russia\u2019s exports are cut in half. That would translate to a roughly 41% increase from the recent high of nearly $106 a barrel. Gasoline prices would go much higher\nThat spike would sharply raise prices at the gas pump too. The US national average for regular gasoline already stands at $3.61 a gallon, according to AAA. That\u2019s up 8 cents in a week and 25 cents in a month.\n\nEven though the United States consumes very little Russian oil \u2014 oil imports from Russia stood at just 90,000 barrels per day in December \u2014 this is still an interconnected and global market. Supply shocks in one part of the world can impact prices everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wild card if Russia will actually slow those flows to try to inflict pain through commodities,\u201d said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. \u201cIf there are actual supply disruptions, that\u2019s the trigger for meaningful price increases.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there is no evidence at this point that Russia is cutting off the world from its oil supplies. And the West has gone out of its way to carve out Russia\u2019s energy industry from sanctions in the hopes of minimizing the market impact. Putin may very well decide this is one weapon best left unfired. Not long ago, it was viewed as very unlikely that Putin would resort to weaponizing oil.\n\nuch a strategy risks further enraging the rest of the world against Russia. Worse, limiting shipments of oil would endanger Russia\u2019s petro-central economy. Oil and natural gas made up about 43%, on average, of the Russian government\u2019s annual revenue between 2011 and 2020. However, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has escalated quickly, marking the worst fracture with the West since the Cold War. And Putin\u2019s aggressive stance and comments have surprised observers, prompting some to question his mental stability and raising concerns about how he will respond to the latest sanctions.\n\nPutin raised eyebrows over the weekend by putting his nuclear forces on high alert. On Monday he lashed out at sanctions imposed by what he described as the \u201cempire of lies.\u201d\n\nPutin is also facing pressure from the oligarchs he relies on for support. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska broke ranks with the Kremlin in recent days, calling for an end to the war.\n\n\u2018I became very nervous\u2019\nHeartened by the fact that Russia has a long history of reliably supplying oil \u2014 even during the height of the Cold War \u2014 Natasha Kaneva saw little risk of the country weaponizing its oil exports. But Kaneva, the head of global commodities research at JPMorgan, is no longer feeling so confident.\n\n\u201cI became very nervous after I listened to Putin\u2019s speech,\u201d Kaneva told CNN last week, referring to the Russian president\u2019s hourlong February 21 remarks airing a list of grievances with the West. \u201cTo me, it was a watershed moment. I felt everything changed.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan exec believes investors are underestimating the risk that Putin will weaponize oil supplies.\n\n\u201cThe market does not need any disruption,\u201d Kaneva said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any shock absorbers. The reaction in the price will be nonlinear.\u201d\n\nNone of that is lost on Putin. Nor is the fact that high gasoline prices are deeply unpopular in the United States, contributing to the worst inflation in nearly 40 years.  Putin does not need to turn the taps completely off to punish the West. Oil markets are so tight that just a modest decrease in supplies from Russia could have a large impact on prices.\n\n\u201cEven if Russia cut supplies by 10% to 20%, the price response would compensate Russia for the loss of supply,\u201d said Rabobank\u2019s Fitzmaurice.\n\nEven before the invasion began, the White House warned Putin against any drastic steps around his country\u2019s energy exports.\n\n\u201cIf Putin decides to weaponize his energy supplies, it would be a major mistake,\u201d Daleep Singh, US deputy national security advisor, said on CNBC.\n\nThe Biden Administration official noted that Russia is \u201cincredibly dependent\u201d on the West as a consumer for its energy supplies.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term vulnerability for President Putin. If he weaponizes energy supply, that\u2019s only going to accelerate Europe\u2019s and the West\u2019s diversification away from Russian energy,\u201d Singh said, adding that it would be a \u201cmajor blunder.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "What MGM movies are mentioned in this article - WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday said it had closed its $8.5 billion deal to buy MGM, combining the fabled moviemaker behind \"Rocky\" and James Bond with the online retailing giant as it looks to draw consumers through more streaming video.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon said it would welcome all MGM employees to the company and work with the studio's leadership, indicating there would not be layoffs. Its decision to close comes after a deadline passed for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to challenge the deal.\n\nThe Seattle-based retailer announced the transaction in May 2021, saying MGM offered a trove of content to draw consumers to its fast-shipping and streaming club Prime, which costs $14.99 per month in the United States.\n\nNearly a year later, Amazon is clear of regulatory hurdles. The European Commission approved the deal Tuesday, with no conditions. Likewise, Amazon earlier informed the FTC that it had \"substantially complied\" with requests for information about the deal. read more\n\nAccording to Amazon, MGM's staff will join the organization of Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios.\n\nMGM bolsters Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated \"Licorice Pizza\" and a long list of television shows that may help Amazon compete with streaming rivals Netflix and Disney+ (DIS.N).\n\nHopkins praised MGM's \"broad slate of original films and television shows.\"\n\n\"We welcome MGM employees, creators, and talent to Prime Video and Amazon Studios, and we look forward to working together,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAn FTC spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific transaction but noted that the agency may challenge a deal after it closes \"if it determines that it violates the law.\"\n\nThe FTC has a broader probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook and Google."}

The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, twins who were suckled by a she-wolf as infants.[1] Another account, set earlier in time, claims that the Roman people are descended from Trojan War hero Aeneas, who escaped to Italy after the war, and whose son, Iulus, was the ancestor of the family of Julius Caesar.[2] The archaeological evidence of human occupation of the area of modern-day Rome dates from about 14,000 years ago.["}

{"prompt": "According to the following text, what does the \"Z\" mean?\n\nSeveral theories have circulated as to what the \"Z\" symbol actually means. It first caught attention on social media after Russian tanks with \"Zs\" on the side were spotted en route to Ukraine.\n\nInitially, it was thought that the \"Z\" was in fact a number \"2\" - representing the 22 February (22/02/2022). That was the day Russia ratified an agreement on \"friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance\" with the self-proclaimed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nBut it is now believed the symbol is simply a way for Russia's military to identify its own forces.\n\nLast week, viewers to a news programme on Russia's state-controlled Channel One were told that a \"Z\" was a common marking on Russian military equipment. The Orthodox Christian pro-Putin website Tsargrad told readers the simple marking could \"avoid friendly fire\" and couldn't be \"mixed up with anything else\".\n\nRussian special forces veteran Sergey Kuvykin told the Russian magazine website, Life, that different symbols signified different military units. \"Symbols like these are used - a 'Z' in a square, a 'Z' in a circle, a 'Z' with a star or simply 'Z' on its own.\" He said the markings helped make sure that troops, who might not be in contact with other comrades, were where they should be.\n\nRussian warplanes fly too quickly to see the daubed white markings, says US Air Force Lt Col Tyson Wetzel - a senior Air Force fellow with The Atlantic Council think tank. But, in an interview with the Task and Purpose website, he agrees the \"Zs\" are a \"de-confliction measure to help prevent fratricide\" - friendly fire from Russian attack helicopters or artillery."}

The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, still must pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. The White House has not said whether Biden supports it.\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said after input from airlines and broadcasters that supporters agreed that the change would not take place until November 2023.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America but it is one of those issues that there is a lot of agreement. ... If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore,\" Rubio added. \"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nAbout 30 states since 2015 have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue this month. Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said that \"the loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found that 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nSupporters argue it could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\nThe use of daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was adopted in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time."}
{"prompt": "Can you summarize this into a tweet - BELIZE CITY, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate arrived in Belize on Saturday for a weeklong Caribbean tour that was marred by a local protest before it even began amid growing scrutiny of the British Empire's colonial ties to the region.\n\nThe arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge coincides with the celebration of Queen Elizabeth's 70th year on the throne, and comes nearly four months after Barbados voted to become a republic, cutting ties with the monarchy but remaining part of the British-led Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe queen's grandson and his wife are due to spend their first three days in Belize, formerly British Honduras. But on the eve of their departure, an event planned for Sunday was scrapped when a few dozen villagers staged a protest.\n\nResidents of Indian Creek, an indigenous Maya village in southern Belize, told Reuters they were upset that the royal couple's helicopter had been granted permission to land on a local soccer field without prior consultation. read more\n\nThe village is in a land dispute with Fauna & Flora International (FFI), a conservation group supported by the royal family, stirring discontent over colonial-era territorial settlements still contested by indigenous groups.\n\nA visit to a different site is being planned instead, Belize's government said.

{"prompt": "What does the article say about Google's new ability?\n\nGoogle is finally releasing a \"delete history\" feature, which will wipe out the last 15 minutes of search queries, for the Android Google Search app. \"Delete history\" was announced at Google I/O 2021 in May and made it to the iOS app two months later, but for some reason, it took almost a year to come to Android. It's finally rolling out now, though, according to a statement Google gave to The Verge over the weekend.\n\nIf you want to wipe out the last few minutes of your search history, open the Google Search app via the app icon (other entry points, like the search bar widget, won't bring up the right UI), tap on your profile picture in the top right and you should see a new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option at the top of the pop-up menu. If you don't see the setting yet, try swiping the app away in recent apps and opening it again, which will load the newest configuration from the cloud.\n\nWiping out your search history is sort of like wiping out browser history, but Google stores search history to your account in the cloud. As the app explains, Google Search history tracks \"the things you search for, results you click, and stories you read\" while using the Google app or Google.com. Google also captures your location, plus audio recordings if you run a voice search. The search terms are used to show more relevant ads, of course, but also for future search predictions and to display content in Google Discover.\n\nThe control for search history is under the \"Web & App Activity\" feature. In the app, you can control this setting by tapping on the \"search history\" button just above the new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option, or you can head to myactivity.google.com in a browser. Web & App Activity can be turned off completely, or you can set the system to \"auto-delete\" your data older than three, 18, or 36 months."}

Nichols, marine biologist and author of Blue Mind, confirms a long-held instinct that the water is good for our health, both physical and mental.\n\nHis research shows that being on the water on a boat promotes physiological and psychological changes spanning health and wellness, awe and wonder, creativity and play, and happiness and relaxation:\n\nBoating resets our brain: Being on the water has been shown to offer relaxation, restoration, and happiness, along with the added benefits of exercise, social time, and a connection with nature.\nBoating is meditative: Time spent in nature, especially when it involves water, provides a way to offset the stresses of living and working in modern contexts.\nBoating promotes play and induces creativity: Stress is shown to inhibit creativity. Watersports and aquatic activities are playful activities that trigger the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good chemicals. \nBoating appeals to our senses: The mere sight of water can induce neurochemicals that promote wellness. A lifelong relationship to water, achieved through boating, delivers cognitive, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual benefits for people of all ages and abilities."}

Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.\"\n\nThe 66th edition of Eurovision is due to take place in Turin, after Italian rock band Maneskin won the 2021 contest.\n\nRussia had not announced its act for the contest, which it last won in 2008 with Dima Bilan singing Believe.\n\nIn recent years, it has been one of the strongest Eurovision performers, with five top five finishes in the past decade.\n\nUkraine has selected hip-hop trio Kalush Orchestra, whose song Stefania was written as a tribute to their mothers.\n\nUkraine urges residents to defend the capital\nBBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more\nUkraine's Eurovision act put on hold by broadcaster\nThe band replaced the country's original contestant, Alina Pash, who withdrew last week after facing scrutiny over a trip she made to Russia-controlled Crimea in 2015.\n\nWhile there is no suggestion Pash entered Crimea from Russia, she said the controversy over her visit had overshadowed her participation in the contest.\n\nThe Ukrainian government considers people who enter the territory via Russia to have crossed the border illegally.\n\nMixed feelings over Ukraine's Eurovision triumph\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine have overshadowed previous editions of the song contest.\n\nRussia were favourites to win the competition in 2016, until Ukrainian singer Jamala stole a last-minute victory with a song that depicted the deportation of Crimean Tatars by Josef Stalin in 1944 - a horrific chapter the nation's parliament has described as tantamount to genocide.\n\nThe lyrics were widely interpreted as a criticism of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Jamala, who is herself a Crimean Tartar, appeared to confirm the link when she told the press: \"The main message is to remember and to know this story. When we know, we prevent.\"\n\nOn the path to victory, her song picked up several important votes from former Soviet countries who have traditionally voted for Russia. Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor called the result \"a pointed slap in Russia's face\".\n\nA year later, Russian contestant Julia Samoylova was blocked from entering Ukraine, which was hosting the competition, because she had reportedly toured Crimea without entering it through the border with the Ukrainian mainland.\n\nRussian television station Channel One then announced it would not broadcast the contest or take part.\n\nJamala has now called on Eurovision fans not to ignore Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't know how this is possible, but they bombed peaceful people,\" she said in an Instagram video. \"Please support Ukraine.

Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for the 1951\u201352 season. Roma have won Serie A three times, in 1941\u201342, 1982\u201383 and 2000\u201301, as well as nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In European competitions, Roma has won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960\u201361 and were runners-up in the 1983\u201384 European Cup and the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup.\n\nFifteen players have won the FIFA World Cup while playing at Roma: Attilio Ferraris and Enrique Guaita (1934); Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio (1934 and 1938); Aldo Donati and Pietro Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi Voller and Thomas Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Vincent Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta and Francesco Totti (2006).\n\nSince 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue they share with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the second-largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plan to move to a new stadium, though it is yet to start construction. Having a strong local rivalry, Roma and Lazio contest Derby della Capitale.\n\nThe club's home colours are carmine red and golden yellow, which gives Roma their nickname \"I Giallorossi\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\"). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome."}

Unlike PCR tests and often hard-to-find rapid antigen tests, an antibody test is not a test of whether or not you currently have COVID-19.\n\n\"It absolutely cannot tell you if you're [currently] infected,\" says Cynthia Leifer, a professor at Cornell University's Department of Microbiology and Immunology.\n\nAntibody tests analyze a sample of your blood to determine whether your immune system has mounted one type of defense, either from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus or from getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, the test tries to measure how many antibodies are in your blood. If your result is positive, it means you've likely had some form of exposure. But if it's negative, it could mean a few different things: that you haven't been exposed to the coronavirus or the vaccine or that your antibodies have diminished to a point where the test can no longer detect them."}

The well built reinforced building with its arched arcades survived both the 1906 and the 1989 earthquakes with little damage. It served as the destination for commuters to San Francisco from the East Bay, who rode the ferry fleets of the Southern Pacific and the Key System. It also served as the connection to San Francisco for the transcontinental rail lines of the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Western Pacific which terminated in Oakland, and for the Northwestern Pacific running north from Marin County. The ferry piers north of the clock tower served the Key System, Santa Fe, and Northwestern Pacific, while the piers south of the tower served the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific.[4] A loop track in front of the building enabled convenient transfers to streetcars. A large pedestrian bridge spanned the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry building to facilitate safe crossing of the busy plaza and transit hub. In the 1940s, the bridge was dismantled to supply scrap metal for the Second World War.\n\nUntil the completion of the Bay Bridge (which began to carry railroad traffic) and Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s, the Ferry Building was the second busiest transit terminal in the world, second only to London's Charing Cross Station. After the bridges opened, and the new Key System and Southern Pacific (Interurban Electric/IER) trains began running to the East Bay from the Transbay Terminal in 1939, passenger ferry use fell sharply. In the second half of the 20th century, although the Ferry Building and its clock tower remained a part of the San Francisco skyline, the condition of the building interior declined with changes. Beginning in the 1950s, unsympathetic renovations installed a mezzanine level, broke up the grand space of the Great Nave, and partitioned the ticketing counters and waiting room areas into office space. The formerly grand public space was reduced to a narrow and dark corridor, through which travelers passed en route to the piers. Passengers were made to wait for ferries on outdoor benches, and the ticketing booths were moved to the pier.[5]\n\n\nEmbaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building, February 1982\nIn the late 1950s, the Embarcadero Freeway was built, which passed right in front of the Ferry Building, and views of the once-prominent landmark were greatly obscured from Market Street. Pedestrian access was treated as an afterthought, and the public was cut off from the waterfront.[5]\n\nMarket Street Railway services terminated at a loop in front of the building prior to the construction of the Transbay Terminal. The last streetcars ran on July 2, 1949.[6]\n\nWith the structural failure of the Embarcadero Freeway during the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco was offered the choice of whether to rebuild it or remove the freeway and reconnect the city with the eastern waterfront and the historic Ferry Building. As part of the larger rejection of the 1950s comprehensive freeway plan as unsympathetic to the city's character, and the general unpopularity of the freeway, Mayor Art Agnos led the charge to remove the Embarcadero freeway entirely. It was replaced with a ground-level boulevard, which reconnected a significant portion of San Francisco's waterfront and the rest of the city. Access was restored to Embarcadero Plaza (previously Justin Herman Plaza) and the foot of Market Street, of which the Ferry Building had been an integral part for so many decades."}

Its decision to close comes after a deadline passed for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to challenge the deal.\n\nThe Seattle-based retailer announced the transaction in May 2021, saying MGM offered a trove of content to draw consumers to its fast-shipping and streaming club Prime, which costs $14.99 per month in the United States.\n\nNearly a year later, Amazon is clear of regulatory hurdles. The European Commission approved the deal Tuesday, with no conditions. Likewise, Amazon earlier informed the FTC that it had \"substantially complied\" with requests for information about the deal. read more\n\nAccording to Amazon, MGM's staff will join the organization of Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios.\n\nMGM bolsters Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated \"Licorice Pizza\" and a long list of television shows that may help Amazon compete with streaming rivals Netflix and Disney+ (DIS.N).\n\nHopkins praised MGM's \"broad slate of original films and television shows.\"\n\n\"We welcome MGM employees, creators, and talent to Prime Video and Amazon Studios, and we look forward to working together,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAn FTC spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific transaction but noted that the agency may challenge a deal after it closes \"if it determines that it violates the law.\"\n\nThe FTC has a broader probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook and Google."}

{"prompt": "A new legal opinion from the Biden administration appears to clear the way for wider use of an underutilized harm reduction technique: paying people addicted to drugs for staying clean.\n\nKnown as \"contingency management,\" the idea is supported by decades of research that shows providing repeated small payments for meeting goals in the recovery process has an outsize impact in helping people remain sober. The technique also has been used to help people quit smoking, lose weight and change other unwanted behaviors.\n\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\n\nBut until last week when the inspector general's office for the Department of Health and Human Services posted an advisory legal opinion, its use was sharply limited by concern that any such program would run afoul of a federal law that bars kickbacks to patients. At the request of a company that has been using the method and conducting research on the effectiveness of payments to drug users, people addicted to alcohol and smokers, the government for the first time allayed those fears.\n\nIn the nine-page opinion, Robert DeConti, an HHS assistant inspector general for legal affairs, said Boston-based DynamiCare Health would not face criminal or civil penalties for its payment plan.\n\nVideo: An intimate look at addiction in Washington, D.C.\nScroll back up to restore default view.\n\"Although the arrangement would generate prohibited remuneration under the federal anti-kickback statute if the requisite intent were present, the OIG [Office of Inspector General] will not impose administrative sanctions on requestor in connection with the arrangement,\" DeConti wrote.\n\nThe ruling allows the company to pay clients as much as $599, a sharp increase from the $75 limit the government had previously observed, which many experts considered too low to be effective. DynamiCare chose $599 because it is the most a client can receive without having to pay taxes on the money.\n\nThe opinion and an HHS spokeswoman emphasized that the decision applies only to DynamiCare. Others who want to offer similar inducements would have to receive their own advisory from the OIG. But DynamiCare co-founder David Gastfriend and others who have tried to persuade HHS to allow higher-paying contingency management programs said they expected many others would move quickly to provide the therapy.\n\n\"This is a breakthrough,\" Gastfriend said.\n\nThe Biden administration made eliminating barriers to contingency management a priority when it announced it was embracing harm reduction in April. The administration was embroiled in a minor controversy last month after conservatives launched an online furor erroneously claiming that the government would spend $30 million on pipes for smoking crack cocaine.\n\nContingency management is considered especially valuable for treatment of people addicted to stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine because there are no proven medications for that disorder. Opioid abuse is best treated with medications such as buprenorphine and methadone, though far too few people receive them.\n\nDeaths from stimulants are climbing along with the better-known rise in opioid-induced fatalities. In 2020, the overdose death rate from stimulants such as methamphetamine was up 50% over 2019 and the cocaine overdose death rate rose 22%, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nUnder a waiver from HHS, California is set to launch a $58.5 million test of contingency management for people with stimulant use disorder in July, using Medicaid funds. So far, 27 counties are enrolled in two phases, a participation rate that should yield thousands of clients, said Kelly Pfeifer, deputy director for behavioral health at the California Department of Health Care Services.\n\nUnder the plan, participants would agree to in-person urine tests twice a week for 24 weeks, and receive escalating rewards for each clean test. The payments would start at $10 and escalate to $26.50 in the 12th week, before declining for the second half of the program, and jumping to $21 per test in the final week.\n\nEvidence of drug use in the test would reset the program but clients could receive only $599, Pfeifer said.\n\nThe money would be put on a gift card, with protections built into the program to prevent spending on alcohol, cigarettes, vaping material, marijuana and gambling, she said. But Pfeifer acknowledged that \"no program we will set up will be 100% protected against misuse.\"\n\nAsked why taxpayer dollars should go to people who use illegal drugs, Pfeifer said: \"The data is robust, unequivocal. There's nothing else that works to move people toward recovery.\"\n\nKeith Humphreys, a psychiatry professor and drug policy researcher at Stanford University, said contingency management works because of its emphasis on immediate rewards. People with substance use disorders have even less ability to delay gratification than those who are not in the grip of drugs, he said.\n\n\"You're interested in what's going to happen right now, not what's going to happen in a week or a year,\" Humphreys said. \"You can't think that far ahead, about a larger, later award.\"\n\nPfeifer said the incentives can \"change the reward balance in the brain\" that has been altered by long-term drug use.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has experience with such programs at its hospitals, where it has offered discounts at canteens and other rewards for accomplishing steps toward recovery, Humphreys said.\n\nAn ongoing concern is how clients will fare once the incentives have run out. Coaching and other forms of therapy may well be needed.   Can you summarize this into two concise bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Can you rewrite the following the story, to make it comprehensible?\n\nI'm going to tell you a story that happened when I was 17, this story still freaks me out so much and I don't even know what happened that day, I would like to have your opinion on it.\n\nIt was in November and my friend Jacob was going to have his birthday for these 17 years, me being a good friend I proposed to him to sleep at my house and then go for a walk the next day with friends in the forest. He accepts, everything goes well, he sleeps at my place and the next day we leave with friends for 2 hours of road (for the forest it is a bit far but at the time I lived in the city center)\n\nAfter the road I realize that I forgot the keys to my house at home and that therefore the door to my house was not locked, but hey I tell myself that we are in town and that few people frequent the suburbs to fly. The day is going well and it's time to go home, I was stressed about knowing if my house had been robbed. Then in the end I said to myself that there was little chance.\n\nMy friend Jacob wanted to spend more time with me before I left for my studies and so did he, so I accepted that he still sleeps with me. We walk in and I see that my house is intact but it was nice and wide open, so I walked around the house and noticed something. The cellar door (which I never open) was open and there was white paper on the floor. I quickly realized that we had to call the police and check if there was anyone there so to reassure us, me and Jacob decided to shout that if the stranger didn't come out, the police would take care of it.\n\nI was paralyzed with fear and I feared that the stranger was coming, bad news, the stranger who was in the cellar cried \"you are not at home, get out of where I lock you up\" Jacob got scared and asked me to come and see if there was the police, luckily she was there and took him away in a car, the police found kitchen knives, an axe, iron chains and a board, there was also a white sheet on which was written \"behind you\". I didn't understand from the beginning, the police told me later that the individual ran away from an asylum, today I am 25 and now I always check if I have the key on me or not."}

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.[a] These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010),[4][5] the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.[6]\n\nIn November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange over allegations of sexual misconduct.[7] Assange said the allegations were a pretext for his extradition from Sweden to the United States over his role in the publication of secret American documents.[8][9] After losing his battle against extradition to Sweden, he breached bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London in June 2012.[10] He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012[11] on the grounds of political persecution, with the presumption that if he were extradited to Sweden, he would be eventually extradited to the US.[12] Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019, saying their evidence had \"weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.\"[13]\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. election campaign, WikiLeaks published confidential Democratic Party emails, showing that the party's national committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival Bernie Sanders in the primaries.[14]\n\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities.[15] The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested.[16] He was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison.[17] The United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange related to the leaks provided by Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as press freedom organisations, criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act, characterising it as an attack on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press.[18][19] On 4 January 2021, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled against the United States' request to extradite him and stated that doing so would be \"oppressive\" given concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide.[20] On 6 January 2021, Assange was denied bail, pending an appeal by the United States.[21] On 10 December 2021, the High Court in London ruled that Assange can be extradited to the US to face the charges.[22]\n\nAssange has been confined in Belmarsh maximum-security prison in London since April 2019.[23]"}

Long time ago, there lived four cows in a jungle. They were best friends. They always grazed together and saved each other in danger. Due to this unity, even the tigers and lions could not kill and eat them. A lion had indeed an eye upon these cows. But he could never find the right opportunity to make them his prey. One day, the cows had a fight among themselves. Each one grazed separately her own way. The lion and the tiger got to know about the fight of the cows. So, they planned to trick all the cows. One day, lion and the tiger found the right opportunity to attack them. So, they hid themselves behind the bushes and waited for the lonely cow. When a lonely cow came closer to the bushes, they pounced upon her and kill her for his meals. In this way, all the four cows were killed one by one by them ."}

{"prompt": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts used to imagine what what it might be like to have Freddie Freeman on his side.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to wonder anymore.\n\nAll the speculation about Freeman joining the Dodgers went from rumor to real when the five-time All-Star, former Atlanta Braves first baseman and free agent agreed to a six-year deal worth $162 million late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOn paper, it\u2019s a great lineup, as good as any I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said Thursday.\n\nFreeman was expected to arrive in camp Friday, a day after he underwent a physical in Los Angeles.\n\nRoberts\u2019 bold optimism was echoed throughout the Dodgers\u2019 clubhouse. In Freeman, the Dodgers said they have another star, a fourth former MVP on their 2022 roster. His left-handed bat figures to fill a hole left when Corey Seager signed with the Texas Rangers in late November.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a position player in a lineup of all All-Stars,\u2019\u2019 said pitcher Clayton Kershaw, a former MVP along with teammates Mookie Betts and Cody Bellinger. \u201cWith what Freddie brings, he\u2019s got to be, if not the best, a top three or four hitter in the game.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the hitting, Roberts says the 32-year-old Freeman will create more options in the field.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t exactly project what the lineup will be right now,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said. \u201cBut this roster was already very versatile. Now, there\u2019s so much more we can do with somebody who is already one of the premier hitters in the game.\"\n\n\u201cNow, we should grind teams, go deep into the \u2018pens. We should score runs,\u201d e said.\n\nInfielder Justin Turner was happy to have a player he knew from his days as a kid in Southern California. Freeman grew up in Orange County and Turner is from Long Beach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Freddie for a long time,\u2019\u2019 Turner said. \u201cWe grew up playing together. I\u2019ve been recruiting him to the Dodgers for the last five years.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, and that\u2019s probably an understatement. Obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of buildup and a lot of talk and a lot of anticipation as to what was going to happen. To finally see it go down and be official was \u2013\u2013 I slept really good,\" he said.\n\nFreeman hit .300 with 31 homers and 83 RBIs last season.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s always been a great hitter. Add him to our lineup, and it could be ridiculous, to be honest. He knows how to drive in runs. That\u2019s an art form. It\u2019s not something you learn overnight, he said.\n\nFreeman, an Angels fan as a kid, helped eliminate the Dodgers in last year\u2019s NL Championship Series. The Braves went on to win the World Series, beating the Houston Astros in six games.\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t talk to him then.\n\n\u201cI was too angry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nRoberts waited to speak to Freeman in a call with Dodgers baseball operation president Andrew Friedman just before the lockout started on Dec. 2.\n\n\u201cFor him to take the call from me and Andrew, pre-lockout, showed me that his interest was sincere,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said.\n\nFor the Dodgers to close the deal, Kershaw said, is another example of why the franchise continues to be successful.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent money,\" said Kershaw, who signed a one-year deal to stay with the Dodgers last Friday, ending speculation that he might jump to the Rangers. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone and done it. Some years have been a little different than others.\"\n\n\u201cBut I would say the majority of the time they (owners) have been pretty consistent with their actions and proving to us that they really want to do whatever it takes to win,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for that. It\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to come back. You still see what\u2019s going on with other teams right now so it\u2019s just even more of a reason to be happy to be here.\u201d\n\nCan you give me 2 concise bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 facts about avalanches based on the text below?\n\nAvalanches are most common during the winter, December to April in the Northern Hemisphere, but they do occur year-round.\n\nTo get an avalanche, you need a surface bed of snow, a weaker layer that can collapse, and an overlaying snow slab. The highest risk period is during and immediately after a snow storm. Underlying snowpack, overloaded by a quick deluge of snow, can cause a weak layer beneath the slab to fracture naturally.\n\nHuman-triggered avalanches start when somebody walks or rides over a slab with an underlying weak layer. The weak layer collapses, causing the overlaying mass of snow to fracture and start to slide. Earthquakes can also trigger strong avalanches.\n\nBy digging a snow pit or profile, scientists can look at the composition of different snow layers that formed during a season, sort of like looking at the layers of a cake. The size and shape of the snowflakes in each layer provide clues about the weather events that occurred: big dumps of snow, drought, rain, a hard freeze, or loose, powdery snow. Larger, looser snow crystals are weaker, because there are fewer points they can touch to interact with the other snow layers. The interaction of the snow layers can help predict the chances of an avalanche.\n\n\u201cSnow is an incredibly dynamic and complicated medium, which means avalanches are the same,\u201d says Trautman. He emphasizes that conditions can change rapidly with the weather, and this can be deadly.\n\nSlopes shaded from direct sun stay cooler, preventing bonding between snow layers and leading to more avalanches in cold conditions. Conversely, during the spring, sunny mountainsides have a higher risk for avalanches because of rapid warming and melting. The number of \u201cwet snow\u201d slides could increase in the future with climate change, experts warn.\n\nPrecipitation type and intensity, temperature, wind, slope steepness and orientation (the direction it faces), terrain, vegetation, and general snowpack conditions can influence whether and how snow moves down a slope. Moving across the terrain, slight changes in slope or how the mountainside is oriented towards the sun can create drastically different conditions."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this study?\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Our previous study suggested that licorice has anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglial cells and anti-oxidative activity in tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative liver damage. In this study, we evaluated the effect of licorice on chronic alcohol-induced fatty liver injury mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nMethods: Raw licorice was extracted, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of its components was performed by using LC-MS/MS. Mice were fed a liquid alcohol diet with or without licorice for 4 weeks.\n\nResults: We have standardized 70% fermented ethanol extracted licorice and confirmed by LC-MS/MS as glycyrrhizic acid (GA), 15.77 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcg/mg; liquiritin (LQ), 14.55 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcg/mg; and liquiritigenin (LG), 1.34 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mg, respectively. Alcohol consumption increased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and the levels of triglycerides and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Lipid accumulation in the liver was also markedly induced, whereas the glutathione level was reduced. All these alcohol-induced changes were effectively inhibited by licorice treatment. In particular, the hepatic glutathione level was restored and alcohol-induced TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly inhibited by licorice.\n\nConclusion: Taken together, our data suggests that protective effect of licorice against alcohol-induced liver injury may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity and enhancement of antioxidant defense."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article for me?   The trade that brought quarterback Matthew Stafford to Los Angeles last year was a fresh start for both player and team. The former No. 1 pick desperately needed a change in scenery after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff at QB. But Stafford and his new team were already running out of time: The Rams had traded away numerous future draft picks with a single-minded focus on winning right now, while their new QB had just turned 33 \u2014 with a lot of extra mileage \u2014 days after the trade was announced. With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.\n\nFortunately for the Rams, it didn\u2019t \u2014 and now Stafford and company are a win over the Cincinnati Bengals away from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Stafford\u2019s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career Approximate Value (AV) of 133 had already far exceeded the number we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick (73). Back in 2011, the so-called Year of the Quarterback, Stafford was front and center, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season had ever seen such prolific passing. (Stafford remains one of just six QBs to surpass 5,000 yards and 40 touchdown passes in a single season.) Over his career, Stafford was easily the winningest quarterback in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL\u2019s oldest teams, and the second-best player in franchise history according to AV \u2014 trailing only the incomparable Barry Sanders.\n\nBut although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit \u2014 its only three postseason berths this century \u2014 the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions\u2019 defense was largely ineffective during Stafford\u2019s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team\u2019s offense was also surprisingly mediocre \u2014 scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.\n\nThat all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the second-best performance of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, second-best (in a tie) by AV, third-best by QB value over replacement, fourth-best by Total Quarterback Rating and fourth-best by Football Outsiders\u2019 Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay\u2019s offense that Goff couldn\u2019t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn\u2019t perfect in his Rams debut \u2014 he tied for the league lead in interceptions, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff\u2019s last year (2.4 percent) \u2014 he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.\n\nStafford also performed much better under pressure \u2014 both literal and metaphorical \u2014 which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.\u2019s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL\u2019s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff\u2019s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage \u2014 he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year \u2014 opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay\u2019s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats, than Stafford did.\n\nStafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL\u2019s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams\u2019 offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted expected points added (EPA) per game \u2014 and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically \u2014 last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.\n\nSuch second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,1 much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:"}
{"prompt": "Can you summarise the below text please:\n\nApartheid (/\u0259\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0rt(h)a\u026at/, especially South African English: /\u0259\u02c8p\u0251\u02d0rt(h)e\u026at/, Afrikaans: [a\u02c8part\u0266\u025bit]; transl. \"separateness\", lit. \"aparthood\") was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1948 until the early 1990s.[note 1] Apartheid was characterized by an authoritarian political culture based on baasskap (boss-hood or boss-ship), which ensured that South Africa was dominated politically, socially, and economically by the nation's minority white population.[4] According to this system of social stratification, white citizens had the highest status, followed by Indians and Coloureds, then black Africans.[4] The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day.[5][6][7]\n\nBroadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid, which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid, which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race.[8] The first apartheid law was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949, followed closely by the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, which made it illegal for most South African citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines.[9] The Population Registration Act, 1950 classified all South Africans into one of four racial groups based on appearance, known ancestry, socioeconomic status, and cultural lifestyle: \"Black\", \"White\", \"Coloured\", and \"Indian\", the last two of which included several sub-classifications.[10] Places of residence were determined by racial classification.[9] Between 1960 and 1983, 3.5 million black Africans were removed from their homes and forced into segregated neighbourhoods as a result of apartheid legislation, in some of the largest mass evictions in modern history.[11] Most of these targeted removals were intended to restrict the black population to ten designated \"tribal homelands\", also known as bantustans, four of which became nominally independent states.[9] The government announced that relocated persons would lose their South African citizenship as they were absorbed into the bantustans.[8]"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty."}

His first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician \u201canalyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal\u201d.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as \u201cmysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition\u201d.\n\nCombined with nearly 150 \u201ccarefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs\u201d, the collection \u201cresembles an epic poem\u201d, said S&S.\n\nJonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: \u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.\u201d\n\nDylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016. His latest album, 2020\u2019s Rough and Rowdy Ways, received mass critical acclaim and was placed highly in many publications\u2019 end-of-year lists.\n\nIn January, he sold his entire recorded catalogue to Sony Music Entertainment, following the sale in 2020 of his publishing catalogue to Universal Music.\n\nDylan is currently fighting a lawsuit that alleges he groomed and sexually abused a woman, referred to as JC, when she was 12 years old. His legal team have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit \u201ca brazen shakedown ... false, malicious, reckless and defamatory\u201d.\n\nThe Philosophy of Modern Song is published on 8 November , with an accompanying audiobook partially narrated by Dylan."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article please: The iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, or \u201cT. Rex,\u201d might need to be re-categorized into three distinct species, according to researchers. \n\nThe Tyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus to date \u2013 though previous research has reportedly acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurs skeletal remains. \n\nIn a controversial new study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Evolutionary Biology, South Carolina and Maryland paleontologists conducted an analysis of skeletal remains they said reveal physical differences in the femur and other bones and dental structures.\n\nBased on a dataset of 37 specimens, the group looked at the robustness in the femur of 24 specimens and measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender teeth resembling incisors. \nAccording to an accompanying release, the scientists observed that the femur varied across specimens, with two times more robust femurs than svelte ones across specimens. Robust femurs were also found in some juvenile specimens and \u201cgracile\u201d femurs were found in some that were full adult size, suggesting that variation is not related to growth. \n\nDental structure also varied and those with one incisorform tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.They explained the Tyrannosaurus specimens \u201cexhibit such a remarkable degree of proportional variations, distributed at different stratigraphic levels, that the pattern favors multiple species at least partly separated by time; ontogenetic and sexual causes being less consistent with the data.\u201d\n\n\u201cVariation in dentary incisiform counts correlate with skeletal robusticity and also appear to change over time,\u201d the authors noted. \n\n28 specimens could be identified in distinct layers of sediment at the Lancian upper Maastrichtian formations in North America \u2013 which was estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago \u2013 and the paleontologists compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.Only robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment \u2013 and variation was not different to that of other theropod species \u2013 which the release said indicates that just one species of Tyrannosaurus likely existed at this point. \n\nHowever, the variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher, suggesting the specimens had physically developed into more distinct forms and other dinosaur species. \n\nSEE ALSO\n\nAbout 2.5 billion T. Rex roamed Earth but not at once\n\u201cWe found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen,\u201d lead author Gregory Paul said in a statement. \u201cWe propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.\u201d\n\nBased on that evidence, the researchers said three morphotypes \u2013 what Science Direct defines as any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population \u2013 and two additional species of Tyrannosaurus were \u201cdiagnosed\u201d and named. \n\n\u201cOne robust species with two small incisors in each dentary appears to have been present initially, followed by two contemporaneous species (one robust and another gracile) both of which had one small incisor in each dentary, suggesting both anagenesis and cladogenesis occurred,\u201d they continued. \n\nEvolution can take place by anagenesis, in which changes occur within a lineage. Whereas, in cladogenesis, a lineage splits into two or more separate lines.\n\nThe authors nominated two potential species: \u201cTyrannosaurus imperator\u201d and \u201cTyrannosaurus regina.\u201d\n\nTyrannosaurus imperator relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth.\n\nTyrannosaurus regina is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The Tyrannosaurus rex was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment, with more robust femurs and only one incisor tooth. \n\nThe authors acknowledged that they cannot rule out that variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups. They also cautioned that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. \n\nReaction to the study from scientists has been largely skeptical, with some claiming the paper does not have enough evidence to reach its conclusions \u2013 and raising concerns over some of the specimens included in the study to National Geographic.\n\nPaul told The New York Times on Feb. 28 that he knows his proposal is provocative. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that there could be a lot of people who aren\u2019t going to be happy about this,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cAnd, my response to them is: Publish a refutation.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me one important fact from the information below?\n\nHow to save water: 10 tips for saving water around the home\nThe majority of household water use comes from toilets, washing machines, showers, baths, faucets and leaks, but what you can do to save water is fairly simple. These 10 water-saving tips will put you on the path to conserving water in your household.\n\nPut a brick in your toilet\u2019s water tank. You flush an average of 20 gallons of water a day down the toilet. If you don\u2019t have a high-efficiency toilet, try filling your tank with something that will displace some of that water, such as a brick.\n\nUse the right amount of water for each load of laundry. Typically 15-40 percent of indoor home water use comes from doing laundry. Save water by making sure to adjust the settings on your machine to the proper load size.\n\nPick your washing machine wisely. When considering top-load vs. front-load washers, front-loading washing machines generally use less water.\n\nWater plants wisely. Water your lawn or garden early in the morning or late in the evening, so the water lasts and is not immediately evaporated by the hot sun.\nInstall a low-flow showerhead. With a low-flow showerhead, you can save 15 gallons of water during a 10-minute shower.\n\nCheck for and repair leaks. An average of 10,000 gallons of water is wasted every year due to household leaks. One of the most effective ways to cut your water footprint is to repair leaky faucets and toilets.\n\nUse a dishwasher. Dishwashing accounts for less than 2 percent of indoor water use, but using a machine is actually more water efficient than hand washing, especially if you run full loads. ENERGY STAR\u00ae dishwashers save about 1,600 gallons of water over its lifetime of use.\nTurn off the water. Teach your whole household to turn off the faucet while brushing teeth or shaving. Every little bit of water conservation helps!\n\nDefrost food in the fridge. Instead of running frozen foods under hot water from the faucet, build in time to let them defrost in the refrigerator.\n\nManage outdoor water use. Don\u2019t forget about water conservation outside as well. Equip all hoses with shut-off nozzles, which can prevent hose leaks."}

This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. They also won the Ted Hughes Award for their play Brand New Ancients in 2013."}

{"prompt": "What vegetables does this article say are good for roasting?\n\nWhen it comes to which vegetables taste best when roasted in the oven, it can be hard to choose the wrong one! Carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, any variety of squash, pumpkin, potatoes, onions, parsnips and beets are some great options.\n\nThe only veggies that don't roast well? If you're thinking about roasting delicate salad greens, like baby spinach or arugula, don't.\n\nMost veggies roast up well simply seasoned with just some olive oil, salt and pepper. You can always spruce up your veggies with a little bacon fat, just like Al Roker.\n\nAlways make sure the oven is fully preheated before roasting: About 375-400 F for root vegetables, and 400-425 F for veggies that have more water. If the oven is the wrong temperature, your cooking time might not yield the desired result.\n\nPreheat your tray in the oven while you prepare your vegetables. This way, when they make contact with the tray, they instantly begin to sizzle and roast. You also may not want to use parchment paper when roasting my vegetables because it limits the browning you get on the surface of the vegetables (but, of course, if you don't want to clean the baking sheet, by all means, use it).\n\nTo make sure your vegetables are evenly coated with oil and seasoning, toss everything together in a bowl before laying them out on the tray. Don't overcrowd the veggies or the hot air won't circulate and the veggies will steam instead of roast.\n\nAbout every 10 minutes or so, rotate the tray in the oven so all the vegetables are being evenly roasted. You should  also stir them around a bit using a spatula to make sure they\u2019re crisping evenly and not sticking to the tray. Some ovens have hot spots where one side cooks more than the others, which is why its always good to rotate your trays while roasting.\n\nIf you try to flip your veggies and they're sticking to the pan, it means they're not ready to flipped. Have patience and the veggies will respect you."}

{"prompt": "I don't know if I should get wired or wireless headphones. My friend sent me this article about the pros and cons of each. Can you give me the TLDR? \"WIRED HEADPHONES\nAh yes, good ol\u2019 wired headphones. They\u2019ve been around since 1910 and are still a dependable choice in the audio world. Below are several advantages and disadvantages of wired headphones or earphones:\n\nPROS OF WIRED HEADPHONES\nPrice: If you\u2019re on a budget and looking to get headphones or earbuds, wired versions \u2013 e.g., T5M Wired Earphones \u2013 almost always cost less than their wireless counterparts. Why? Wireless technology is more expensive to manufacture.\nSound Quality: Audiophiles swear by wired headphones for this reason. Wired headphones receive an analog signal, which can handle more data than Bluetooth\u00ae. Therefore, it offers better sound quality.\nUbiquity: As long as there\u2019s a 3.5mm input, wired headphones can connect to any audio source, from your dad\u2019s Walkman to your brand-new laptop. Many modern smartphones are ditching the standard audio jack, but there are adaptors and cables such as Lightning and USB-C to solve this issue.\nNo Batteries/Charging: Except for active noise-canceling headphones, wired headphones don\u2019t need batteries. Simply plug your headphones or earphones into your audio source, and you\u2019re ready to rock.\nCONS OF WIRED HEADPHONES\nCable: The biggest problem most people have with wired headphones is the cable itself. Desk job workers or anybody who\u2019s stationary for extended periods won\u2019t have an issue with the wire. However, the cable can get in the way when you\u2019re exercising, cleaning the house, or just being mobile. Cords can also get tangled and caught in something, further adding to the annoyance.\nWIRELESS HEADPHONES\nWireless headphones \u2013 particularly true wireless earbuds \u2013 are becoming the go-to listening device among consumers. Check out the pros and cons of wireless headphones to see if they\u2019re right for you.\n\nPROS OF WIRELESS HEADPHONES\nFreedom: No longer are you shackled to your device. With wireless headphones, you can freely walk to 30 feet to the kitchen and grab a handful of pretzels without missing a word of your music or podcast. Plus, the lack of wires makes it easier and more comfortable for joggers to run a 5K, commuters to get to work, and gamers to play video games without sitting too close to the TV.\nAdded Features: If you live for the finer things, wireless headphones certainly deliver. For example, the T5 II True Wireless Earphones can connect to your virtual assistant of choice. Our earphones also provide sweat/water resistance, Klipsch Connect app integration, and four microphones for crystal-clear calls.\nCompatibility: It used to be a luxury for devices to have Bluetooth\u00ae connectivity. Now, it\u2019s a standard for modern technology to boast Bluetooth\u00ae. While you can\u2019t connect to vintage turntables or the like, you can always get an A/V receiver and jam to your favorite tunes via our premium speakers.\nSound Quality: As mentioned before, wired headphones generally sound better than wireless headphones because Bluetooth\u00ae can only handle so much information through its signal. However, this only applies if you\u2019re trying to listen to data-loaded lossless file formats like FLAC, WAV, or ALAC. Have no idea what these things mean? Don\u2019t worry about it. Whether it\u2019s through wired or wireless headphones, most average listeners can\u2019t distinguish a difference between lossless audio and a Spotify/Apple Music stream. Lossless file formats only matter for people who demand the best sound quality possible, like audiophiles, musicians, and DJs.\nCONS OF WIRELESS HEADPHONES\nPrice: Wireless headphones provide plenty of cool features, but they also have a price tag that reflects these features. Don\u2019t fear, though! If you\u2019re interested in the T5 II True Wireless Earphones, you listen now and pay later with our Affirm financing option.\nBattery/Charging: Add wireless headphones to your growing list of things you have to charge. It\u2019s not a huge con by any means since that\u2019s the way the world turns now. However, the battery life of wireless headphones has greatly improved over the years. With the T5 True Wireless Earphones, you get up to 8 hours of battery life on a single charge, plus up to 24 hours with your charging case.\nCONCLUSION\nWhen it comes to choosing between wired and wireless headphones, it\u2019s all up to your personal preferences and lifestyle.\""}

{"prompt": "How long was Peter Pope? - Saint Peter[5] (died between AD 64 and 68 on the Vatican Hill),[1] also known as Simon Peter, Simeon, Simon (/\u02c8sa\u026am\u0259n/ (audio speaker iconlisten)), Cephas (/\u02c8si\u02d0f\u0259s/),[6] or Peter the Apostle, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, and one of the first leaders of the early Church. Based on contemporary historical data, his papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years;[1] however, the length of his reign was never verified.\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is traditionally counted as the first bishop of Rome\u200d\u2014\u200cor pope\u200d\u2014\u200cand also by Eastern Christian tradition as the first bishop of Antioch. The ancient Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Diocese of Rome,[1] but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to Catholic teaching, Jesus promised Peter a special position in the Church.[7]\n\nIn the New Testament, the name \"Simon Peter\" is found 19 times. He appears repeatedly and prominently in all four gospels as well as the Acts of the Apostles. He is the brother of Saint Andrew, and both were fishermen. The Gospel of Mark in particular was traditionally thought to show the influence of Peter's preaching and eyewitness memories. He is also mentioned, under either the name Peter or Cephas, in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians. The New Testament also includes two general epistles, First Peter and Second Peter, that are traditionally attributed to him, but modern scholarship generally rejects the Petrine authorship of both.[8] However, there is a growing number of scholars that have resuscitated the Petrine authorship of the Petrine epistles.[9]\n\nOutside of the New Testament, several apocryphal books were later attributed to him, in particular the Acts of Peter, Gospel of Peter, Preaching of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, and Judgment of Peter, although scholars believe these works to be pseudoepigrapha.[10][11][12]"}

{"prompt": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). Heralding the album era, their success elevated the album to be the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also inspired a greater public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active."}

{"prompt": "This article is confusing me. Has Russia invaded Ukraine based according to it? \"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.\n\nIt is unclear if Russian troop movements marked the beginning of an invasion of Ukraine that Western leaders have warned about for weeks. But multiple US and Western officials warned Monday\u2019s move could serve as the opening salvo of a larger military operation targeting the country.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Monday night, Putin blasted Kyiv\u2019s growing security ties with the West, and in lengthy remarks about the history of the USSR and the formation of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, appeared to cast doubt on Ukraine\u2019s right to self-determination.\n\n\u201cUkraine has never had traditions of its own statehood,\u201d he said, calling the eastern part of the country \u201cancient Russian lands.\u201d\n\nThe decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow\u2019s official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine \u2013 the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (DPR and LPR). The decrees recognized them as independent states, and guaranteed their security with Russian troops. The decrees said that Russian so-called peacekeeping forces would be deployed in the regions. A senior US administration official said the speech was meant to \u201cjustify war\u201d to the Russian people and that it amounted to \u201can attack on the very idea of a sovereign and independent Ukraine\u201d using \u201ca number of false claims\u201d meant to justify military action.\n\n\u201cThe human costs of a further Russian invasion and occupation will be devastating,\u201d the official said.\n\nSeparatists in eastern Ukraine have long had substantial backing from the Kremlin, with the US, NATO and Ukrainian officials saying Moscow supplies them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks. Russia has always denied having its own troops on the ground.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years, with Putin attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens. Kyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukranian government asserts the two regions have been in effect Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.\n\nOn Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin\u2019s decision to recognize the breakaway regions \u201ca clear attack on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty\u201d and said US President Joe Biden would sign an executive order prohibiting \u201call new investment, trade and financing by US persons to, from, and in the so-called \u2018Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics.\u201d\n\nBiden said last month that \u201cif any assembled Russian units move across Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I\u2019ve discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin held a highly choreographed televised meeting with his top officials, accusing Kyiv of carrying out acts of aggression.\n\nPutin also accused the West of threats and blackmail during the previously unscheduled convening of the Russian security council that, in unusually theatrical setting, was shown on television.\n\nThe broadcast aired just hours after the White House announced that US President Joe Biden agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to French-brokered talks with Putin as long as Russia does not further invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said earlier on Monday that there were \u201cno concrete plans\u201d for a meeting.\n\nSpeaking about the possibility of talks with Biden, Putin \u2013 who held two lengthy phone calls with the French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday \u2013 hinted he was skeptical. \u201cYesterday I spoke with the French President on two occasions, with the second call lasting until 2:00 a.m. or so. He assured me that the American position has changed somewhat. But when I asked what these changes are, he, unfortunately, could not say.\u201d Putin said.\n\nHe then referred to remarks made on Sunday by Blinken, who stressed once again that the issue of Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO is \u201can issue for Ukraine and for NATO.\u201d\n\nAssurances that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO in the future are one of the central demands made by the Kremlin.\n\nWith his top officials assembled in front of him at the extraordinary meeting of the security council, Putin appeared following claims made by the Russian military earlier on Monday that troops and border guards engaged in a clash with a \u201csabotage and reconnaissance group from the territory of Ukraine\u201d inside Russian territory.\n\n\u201cRussia has always tried to resolve all conflicts by peaceful means. Nevertheless, the Kyiv authorities conducted two punitive operations in these territories [Donetsk and Luhansk], and it seems that we are now witnessing an escalation for the third time,\u201d Putin said, without further elaborating or providing specifics.\n\nCNN has not independently verified reports of a clash inside Russia\u2019s territory. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba denied a clash occurred, saying on Twitter, \u201cI categorically refute the disinformation of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nKuleba said Ukraine \u201cdid not attack Donetsk, Luhansk, did not send saboteurs or armored personnel carriers across the border, did not fire on the territory of the Russian Federation or the checkpoint at the border, did not commit sabotage, does not plan such actions.\u201d The increase in combative language from Putin came as tensions grew once again in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Joint Forces Operation said it recorded 32 ceasefire violations as of 4 p.m. local time, a number that was roughly in line with those over the weekend.\n\nNew satellite images showed intensified activity among Russian units close to Ukraine\u2019s north-eastern border and the Ukrainian Defense ministry said it recorded dozens of ceasefire violations on Sunday.\n\nDefense minister Oleksii Reznikov said Monday that Ukraine was not seeing any withdrawal of Russian forces from positions close to the border.\n\nAnd in a further escalation, Belarusian officials announced Sunday that joint Russian military exercises in Belarus that were slated to end over the weekend would continue, implying that Russian forces may extend their stay\""}

Players are encouraged to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open-world environment, connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites must be met to unlock certain areas. A central element to the gameplay of Dark Souls is the bonfire. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their \"Estus Flask.\" They can also level up and perform other functions, such as attuning magic and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire respawns all of the world's enemies, except for bosses, mini-bosses, and friendly non-playable characters. The player character's interaction with the world of Dark Souls includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes melee attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of high fantasy, medieval-style weaponry\u2014including swords, spears, maces, and fantastical weaponry such as magical swords, huge greatswords, and immense clubs. For defence, player characters have access to shields, armour, dodging, and parrying. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of mana as in most other fantasy RPGs. Instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them. They can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through levelling, smithing, consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.\""}

Please summarize the article in 3 or 4 sentences for me. \n\nIndependent testing has found hundreds of popular personal care items in the US to be contaminated with benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, prompting several big brands to voluntarily recall dozens of products in recent months.\n\nThe lab, Valisure, last year detected benzene in hand sanitizers, sunscreens, deodorant, dry shampoos, conditioners, antiperspirants, deodorants, body sprays and anti-fungal treatments. The contamination has been most frequently detected in aerosol or spray products, some at levels the Food and Drug Administration characterized as \u201clife-threatening\u201d.\n\nThe findings suggest that benzene contamination is widespread and is probably in more products that have not yet been tested, said David Light, Valisure\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cBenzene really shouldn\u2019t be there at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a fundamental problem in the manufacturing of a lot of consumer products.\u201d To date, Valisure has tested 662 items and found the chemical in 180, or about 27%, of products.\n\nProcter & Gamble, Bayer, CVS and Johnson & Johnson have issued voluntary recalls for widely distributed brands including Brut, Sure, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Old Spice, Secret, Tinactin, Lotrimin, Coppertone, Neutrogena and Aveeno. Among the recalled hand sanitizer brands are Art Naturals, Best Brands and Natural Wunderz.\n\nLight pointed to \u201cdecades of research\u201d that has found no safe levels of benzene exposure because it\u2019s so toxic at very low levels. The petroleum-based chemical \u201ccauses cancer\u201d, especially leukemia and in blood forming organs, the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote. The toxin has also been shown to harm the central nervous system and reproductive organs.\n\nThe US banned benzene\u2019s use as an ingredient nearly 45 years ago, and it is \u201csomewhat unique in that it\u2019s pretty well established to be incredibly toxic \u2013 that\u2019s been known for decades to over a century,\u201d said David Andrews, senior scientist at the public health advocate Environmental Working Group.\n\nAdvocates took aim at the Food and Drug Administration for failing to do more to protect the public. In a December statement, the agency said it was investigating the situation, doing its own testing and urged companies to recall contaminated products.\n\nThough the agency lacks the authority to order recalls and may be limited in its pre-market authority to require testing, advocates are calling on the FDA to clarify an existing benzene limit, set new exposure limits, and conduct more testing of products on store shelves to ensure they are safe, instead of leaving that up to independent labs. The FDA\u2019s system \u201creally lacks independent review\u201d because it relies on companies to self report, Light said.\n\nFederal rules allow benzene to be used in the manufacture of personal care products, and that can cause it to end up in goods, even if it\u2019s not listed as an ingredient. Benzene can also be added in emergency situations, like the pandemic, or if it provides \u201csignificant therapeutic\u201d advantages. In such scenarios, the FDA\u2019s limit is two parts per million, but some products that provided no therapeutic advantage were found with levels as high as 21 ppm.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA wrote it \u201ccontinues to monitor the issue\u201d and work with companies to recall contaminated products. Though the agency doesn\u2019t have exposure limits, it informs companies that \u201csolvents such as benzene should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, or drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity.\u201d\n\nSome companies have capitalized on the confusing regulations and gaps to downplay the problem. Johnson & Johnson, which recalled sunscreens in July, said \u201cdaily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s statement was posted by the FDA on its website even though agency scientists found in a July analysis obtained by Consumer Reports that benzene-contaminated sunscreen did pose a \u201clife-threatening risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cIs the FDA serving these companies or the public?\u201d Andrews asked.\n\nHow benzene is landing in products remains a bit of a mystery in some instances. Companies claim they aren\u2019t adding it to their formulas, and the FDA theorized that it\u2019s probably in contaminated thickening agents, preservatives, spray propellant or ethanol.\n\nIn many cases, Valisure found one batch of a product would contain benzene while another of the same product would not. That highlights the complexities and lack of oversight in the global supply chains that produce personal care products. A propellant like butane that\u2019s refined very early in the manufacturing process \u201ctouches dozens of different hands\u201d in its journey from raw material to sunscreen on a shelf, yet nobody detected benzene, Light said.\n\nValisure most frequently found benzene in body sprays, which includes deodorants and anti-perspirants: nearly half of the 108 products from 30 different brands contained it. The highest levels were found in Sure, Old Spice, Secret, Equate, Right Guard, Tag and Brut.\n\nValisure tested nearly 300 sunscreens or after-sun products and found detectable levels in 77, or about 27%, of samples. Among those with the highest levels were Neutrogena, CVS, Sun Bum, Raw Elements and Banana Boat. Though spray-on sunscreen was found to be contaminated most frequently, the chemical was also detected in lotions and gels.\n\nValisure\u2019s hand sanitizer analysis found the highest levels of benzene in small brands that popped up as demand for the product spiked. Out of 260 samples from 168 brands sold on Amazon, at pharmacies and at box stores such as Target, 44, or about 17%, had detectable levels of benzene. Products from household names like Purell and Suave didn\u2019t contain the chemical.\n\nIn its December statement, TPC Hot Acquisition, which owns Brut and Sure, wrote: \u201cTo date, no reports of adverse events related to this recall have been reported. This voluntary recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s nearly impossible to legally prove that one specific chemical has caused an illness, and Andrews noted benzene has a latency period of 10 to 15 years. \u201cThe time lag between exposure and cancer can be a long period of time,\u201d he said."}

Next year\u2019s game in Deutschland will be one of five played outside the United States, including three in the United Kingdom and one in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to welcome Munich and Frankfurt to the NFL family and are excited to reward our fans in Germany for their passion by bringing them the spectacle of regular-season NFL football,\u201d NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to staging our first game in Germany at FC Bayern Munich\u2019s fantastic stadium later this year and to exploring areas of broader collaboration with the Bundesliga.\u201d\n\nWhat that statement ignored, however, was the groundwork that laid the foundation for American football to grow in Germany. That was the World League of American Football (WLAF), which later became NFL Europe.\n\nThe WLAF began life in 1991 as a typical failure of a spring football league, backed by the NFL itself as a potential feeder to the big stage.

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

She was 48 years old and on the precipice of a long-awaited comeback that was tragically cut short the night before the 2012 Grammy Awards. But she\u2019s far from forgotten, thanks to the work of Houston\u2019s estate and its partners at Primary Wave Music, who continue to unspool plans that will keep the superstar\u2019s legacy top of mind for years to come.\n\nA renewed focus on Houston\u2019s music began as soon as Primary Wave partnered with the estate in 2019, taking a 50% stake in the singer\u2019s music assets.\n\n\u201cIt was time to rebuild Whitney\u2019s business and Primary Wave, with its arsenal of industry professionals, were the right fit, a team packaged to elevate Whitney\u2019s legacy to the next level,\u201d says Pat Houston, the late artist\u2019s sister-in-law and former manager, who serves as an executor of her estate.\n\n\u201cWe have massively, over the course of our three-year partnership, improved the earnings of the estate,\u201d adds Primary Wave founder and CEO Larry Mestel. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically quadrupled the earnings stream of the estate through a lot of low-hanging fruit: renegotiation of partnerships, focusing on merchandise, digital strategy and social media enhancement \u2014 upping the game in general.\u201d\n\nThe first salvo in the company\u2019s stewardship was a Kygo remix of Houston covering Steve Winwood hit \u201cHigher Love.\u201d The 2019 version reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Play chart and No. 7 on Adult Contemporary radio, not only sparking streaming gains for her body of work, but spurring a series of branding and merchandise opportunities.\n\nMestel sees even greater growth on the horizon, starting with the Dec. 23 premiere of the Kasi Lemmons-directed biopic \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody.\u201d\nCan you summarize this into 2 bullet points please?"}

Mike Thompson, D-California, John Larson, D-Connecticut, and Lauren Underwood, D-Illinois, have introduced the Gas Rebate Act of 2022. The bill proposed sending Americans an \u201cenergy rebate\u201d or $100 per month with an additional $100 per dependent for the rest of 2022 in any month where the national average gas price exceeds $4 a gallon.\n\n\u201cAmericans are feeling the impact at the pump of Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and right now we must work together on commonsense policy solutions to ease the financial burden that my constituents are feeling,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe Putin Price Hike is putting strain on our economy, and I am proud to be working with Reps. Larson and Underwood to introduce this legislation to provide middle-class Americans with monthly payments to ease the financial burden of this global crises.\u201d\n\nThe rebate would follow the same guidelines as the most recent Economic Impact Payment:\n\n$100 for single filers earning less than $75,000 phasing out at $80,000\n$100 for joint filers earning less than $150,000 and phasing out at $160,000.\nThe bill does not include information on how the payments would be funded and Congress has been hesitant to restart any other form of stimulus payments, so chances of passage are unlikely. The bill comes after more than a month of record-high gas prices with little relief at the pump in sight.\n\nAs of today, the national average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. is $4.24, according to AAA."}

{"prompt": "The title of this article is titled \"The Food at Subway isn't what you think it is\" What does the article actually say about it? \"Despite some recent struggles, Subway remains a giant in the fast food world. With nearly 24,000 locations, it is the largest restaurant chain in the country, and it brings in billions of dollars in revenue each year. But with great power comes great responsibility, and Subway has not always lived up to its end of the bargain. In particular, the chain hasn't always delivered to its customers the food they think they are getting.\n\nNearly every aspect of a Subway sandwich \u2014 the meat, the vegetables, and even the bread \u2014 has come under scrutiny for not being what the restaurant claims it to be. In some instances, the company has acknowledged its faults and corrected the problem. Other times, Subway has been defiant and pushed back against accusations. So whether it's getting cheated out of an extra inch of sandwich, eating bread filled with unpronounceable ingredients, or devouring tuna that might not actually be tuna, here are a few examples of food at Subway that isn't really what you think it is. Subway is no stranger to the accusation that it serves mystery meat. Not too long ago, a Canadian news outlet conducted DNA analysis on the sandwich maker's chicken to find that the meat was, in fact, only 50 percent chicken. Subway's latest protein controversy centers on the chicken of the sea. A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Subway's tuna is not tuna at all. The lawsuit states that the ingredient is \"a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a restaurant passed off one fish for another. But the most troubling part of this new allegation is the claim that what Subway is calling \"tuna\" isn't a cheaper fish substitute. Speaking with The Washington Post, an attorney for the plaintiffs claimed lab tests showed the ingredients were \"not fish,\" declining to say what precisely what they found to be were. This makes one former employee's claim that the tuna salad was one bag of tuna and three bags of mayonnaise look like an upgrade.\n\nSubway denied the allegations, but the plaintiffs are still suing for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and other claims, arguing they \"were tricked into buying food items that wholly lacked the ingredients they reasonably thought they were purchasing.\"\n\nOverseas, a court ruled Subway's bread didn't qualify as actual bread\n\nSubway received a particularly humbling piece of news in late 2020 when Ireland's Supreme Court ruled that the restaurant's bread was, believe it or not, not actually bread \u2013 at least in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe problem, according to the court, is the amount of sugar Subway includes in its bread recipe. Ireland's Value-Added Tax Act allows \"staple\" foods, including bread, to be exempt from certain taxes. But the law only allows bread's sugar to be a maximum of 2 percent of the weight of flour, otherwise it's more of a pastry. Not only does Subway's bread recipe have more than the allotted sugar amount, it has five times more.\n\nThe case was brought to the court by an Irish franchisee who was hoping to get a tax refund. It clearly did not work out in their favor. The franchisor was none too pleased either, pushing back against the ruling \u2014 without arguing the court's reasoning. They issued a statement, saying \"Subway's bread is, of course, bread. We have been baking fresh bread in our restaurants for more than three decades and our guests return each day for sandwiches made on bread that smells as good as it tastes.\"\n\nSubway's food is not as healthy as it seems\n\nSubway was able to establish itself as one of the quick-service restaurant giants by promoting itself as the healthier alternative to traditional fast food. But the healthy reputation isn't entirely accurate.\n\nIn general, Subway does offer a wider array of healthier options than the average burger joint. But you need to be careful what you order, and what you're adding on to that order. Although many sandwiches are low in things like sugar, they often have bloated fat and sodium levels. And the restaurant does its best to hide this, as one former employee explained. \"When you walk into a Subway store, you'll see all of our menus have the calories listed with each sandwich ... What you can't read is the small print on the menu, which specifies that these values are only for a six-inch sub, on 'standard recipe' (nobody knows what the [heck] that is) white bread, with no cheese or sauce.\"\n\nTherefore, you can easily be tricked into thinking you're getting a low-fat, low-calorie sandwich. But if you're ordering a foot-long sandwich with cheese and sauce (which 99 percent of the customers do, according to the employee), you're roughly tripling those numbers.\""}

It will also \"transform and significantly expand\" the zoo's existing RainForest attraction.\n\nThe Primate Forest will be a \"multi-year, multi-phased project\" that zoo officials hope to begin construction on as early as next year. The total cost has not yet been determined as construction plans continue to be finalized. The Cleveland Zoological Society is actively fundraising for the project, which is expected to be funded primarily by philanthropic donations.  \n\nZoo officials say the initial expansion will be centered around the two-story CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery, a new entranceway to the Primate Forest \"that will immerse guests in the wonders of the natural world through interactive technology, multi-story play structures and more.\"\n\n\u201cThe partnership with CrossCountry Mortgage is catalytic to bringing a truly transformative experience to Cleveland,\u201d said Cleveland Metroparks CEO Brian M. Zimmerman in a statement. \u201cThe new CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery and yet to be named Primate Forest habitats will connect our guests with wildlife like never before.\u201d\n\nThe Primate Forest will also add two new expansive, multi-story habitats for gorillas and orangutans. This comes after Cleveland Metroparks Zoo celebrated the birth last year of both a baby gorilla and baby orangutan, two of the world\u2019s most endangered primates. The Primate Forest will also incorporate the more than 10,000 plants and more than 600 animals that currently live in the rainforest through additional enhancements."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article History\nMain article: History of Los Angeles Metro Rail and Busway\nThe current B Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a subway system. Original proposals in the 1980s had it running down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley. Residents in some parts of the city bitterly opposed the subway. A 1985 methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax gave Rep. Henry Waxman, who represented the Fairfax District, a reason to derail the project that was opposed by his constituents by prohibiting tunneling in an alleged \"methane zone\" west of Western on Wilshire.[4]\n\nAfter some political wrangling, a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n\nInterior decor and stairs to platform level of Hollywood and Vine station\nThe groundbreaking for the first segment of the subway was held on September 29, 1986, on the site of the future Civic Center/Grand Park station.[5] Today's B Line was built in four minimum operating segments:\n\nMOS-1, consisting of five stations from Union Station to Westlake/MacArthur Park, opened on January 30, 1993, as the Red Line. (At this point, the line's operator was still the Southern California Rapid Transit District).[6]\nMOS-2A, consisting of three stations from Westlake/MacArthur Park to Wilshire/Western, opened on July 13, 1996, although only one station on this section (Wilshire/Vermont) is on today's B Line.\nMOS-2B, consisting of five stations from Wilshire/Vermont to Hollywood/Vine, opened on June 12, 1999.[7]\nMOS-3, extending the Red Line from Hollywood/Vine to North Hollywood, opened on June 24, 2000.[8]\nOn June 22, 1995, during the construction of MOS-2B, a sinkhole appeared on Hollywood Boulevard, barely missing several workers and causing damage to buildings on the street.[9] Subway construction was delayed during the investigation and repairs of the sinkhole. The contractor on that segment project was replaced, and because of the perceived mismanagement of Red Line construction, in 1998 voters banned the use of existing sales taxes for subway tunneling.[10]\n\n\nTrain at North Hollywood Metro B Line Station\nConstruction of MOS-3, by comparison, proceeded with relatively few issues. Tunneling from North Hollywood for the subway started in 1995. Workers dug under the Santa Monica Mountains using tunneling machines. Work progressed an average of 50 to 200 ft (15 to 61 m) daily, performed by work crews round-the-clock six days a week.\n\nOriginal proposals for the subway system included expansions east from Union Station to East Los Angeles and west from North Hollywood towards the Warner Center transit hub in the San Fernando Valley. Barred from subway tunneling, Metro turned to other types of mass transit. In the San Fernando Valley, residents passed a law in 1991 mandating that any rail line in the area be built underground,[11][12] so Metro built a busway (now the G Line) from North Hollywood to Warner Center, which opened on October 29, 2005. East of Union Station, Metro built a light rail line with at-grade and underground segments to East Los Angeles, now part of the L Line, which opened on November 15, 2009.\n\nPotential future extensions\n\nEastbound platform at Universal City Station\nExtension to Arts District\nIn 2010, at the request of L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, Metro staff studied the possibility of adding a station along the west bank of the Los Angeles River to 6th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. The study concluded that such an extension, completed at-grade along Metro-owned right-of-way, could be completed for as little as $90 million.\n\nThe study suggested an alternative station at the Division 20 Yard north of 4th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. This station would be closer to the residential population of the Arts District. As new turnback tracks will need to be built as part of the Purple Line Extension (to allow shorter headways), this Arts District extension could possibly be partially completed as part of the Purple Line Extension project, lowering the incremental cost of the station while increasing its usability.[13][14]\n\nExtensions to the South\nMain article: Vermont Transit Corridor\nOne of the proposals for the Vermont Transit Corridor being considered by Metro would extend a subway line from Wilshire/Vermont station down Vermont Avenue to 120th Street. Metro is also considering other types of mass transit for the line, including light rail and busway options."}

An ancient Japanese 'killing stone' which is said to contain an evil demon that will kill anyone who comes into contact with it has split in two, sending superstitious believers into a state of panic.\n\nThe stone is located in the mountainous region of Tochigi, north of Tokyo, where visitors were given a shock over the weekend when they found it separated into two roughly similar sized parts, reports the Guardian. \n\nAccording to mythology, the famous piece of volcanic rock, called the Sessho-seki, contains the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman whose true identity was said to have been an evil nine-tailed fox.\n\n\nLegend has it Tamamo-no-Mae was part of a plot to kill Emperor Toba who ruled Japan from 1107 to 1123.\n\nThe spirit was then said to have been embedded into the stone where it would kill anyone who came into contact with it.  It has been said that the rock was destroyed many years ago and a Buddhist monk exorcised the spirit from it before scattering it across Japan.\n\nHowever, many Japanese people said it was always located on the slopes of Mount Nasu and that its evil spirit may have been resurrected, releasing a poisonous gas, after it was found split in two by tourists over the weekend. \n\n'I feel like I\u2019ve seen something that shouldn\u2019t be seen', said one tourist who tweeted about the discovery on Saturday.\n\nAnother feared the release of an evil demon was just the latest horror of 2022, while one user joked that the spirit would want to spend another millennium stuck inside the rock after looking at the current state of the world. \n\nLocal media reported that the stone is likely to have split in half after rainwater seeped into cracks which first appeared several years ago, causing it to break. Masaharu Sugawara, who leads a local volunteer guide group, told Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun the split was a 'shame' because it was a popular tourist attraction for the area.\n\nHowever, he agreed that rainwater was the likely cause of the split.\n\nThe Shimotsuke Shimbun newspaper reported that local and national government officials will decide what happens to the stone now, with one official saying he would like it returned to its original form. \""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into TWO SHORT sentences:\n\nWhat Do Men Want? by Nina Power; A History of Masculinity by Ivan Jablonka \u2013 reviews\n\nAfew years ago, I sat through an enjoyable lecture by the artist Grayson Perry about the familiar evils of rigid ideas of masculinity: war, imperialism, misogyny, alienation. The lecture was part of a festival called Being a Man (or BAM! for less evolved members of the tribe). Perry ended his comments with a scribbled series of demands on a whiteboard for a new bill of men\u2019s rights, with which it was hard to argue. \u201cWe men ask ourselves and each other for the following: the right to be vulnerable, to be uncertain, to be wrong, to be intuitive, the right not to know, to be flexible and not to be ashamed.\u201d He insisted that men sit down and mostly talk quietly to achieve these aims and was given a rousing standing ovation.\n\nThe need for men to be vulnerable, to open up about their insecurities \u2013 to become, in cliched terms, more like women \u2013 is certainly one antidote to what has become widely understood as the current crisis in masculinity. Thinking about that lecture afterwards, though, it felt a bit limited as a solution. There is no question that mansplainers and manspreaders could do with a fatal dose of humility and doubt. But what about that generation of young men who already feel marginalised from a consumer society, who have been denied most of the markers that traditionally help boys become men: decent jobs, responsible dads, stable homes of their own and, often in consequence, meaningful adult relationships. Would opening up about doubt and vulnerability in itself allow them to achieve self-worth and purpose?\n\nNina Power\u2019s provocative and rigorous book addresses some of those questions from a traditional feminist perspective. When she asked her male friends the question in her book\u2019s title, \u201cWhat do men want?\u201d, most of them played up to stereotypes: \u201cto be left alone\u201d, \u201cpussy\u201d, \u201ca shed\u201d, \u201cNigella Lawson\u201d. While she analyses the predictable adolescence of such responses and what might lie behind them, she is more interested in the aspiration of a single one of her mates: \u201cto be a good man\u201d. What, today, might that look like?\n\nPower, an academic philosopher whose previous book, One Dimensional Woman, was a critique of the limits to choice for women in a capitalist world, begins with a few truisms that our political times have made controversial. \u201cCertain things should be clear from the outset,\u201d she writes, \u201cto be a man is not in itself a bad thing.\u201d And then, in a statement of considerable bravery, at least in certain social media circles: \u201cI believe that the difference between the sexes is real and important on every level of our collective being... sex has a historical as well as a biological reality. It is destructive to everyone to pretend that is not true.\u201d\n\nThe history, she insists, is as important as the biology. While it is at best naive to imagine that any society can, overnight, usefully be reconstructed on gender-neutral grounds (however desirable that outcome), it would truly be absurd to imagine that \u201ceverything that our ancestors understood [about men and women] is irrelevant\u201d. Rather, she insists, \u201cwe would do well to revisit old values and virtues\u201d in order to \u201clive together better\u201d.\n\nIn this context Power examines some of the extreme manifestations of the broken relationship between the sexes. She looks at the economic and cultural circumstances as well as the disturbingly warped psychology that produce \u201cincel\u201d (involuntary celibate) groups, or the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) movement. In addressing this damaged thinking she refuses easy essentialist answers about toxic masculinity or any simplistic notions of patriarchy. She will not, for example, wholly dismiss the appeal of a figure such as Jordan Peterson, who offers the promise of basic structure and meaning in profoundly unstructured and meaningless male lives. If men are to reclaim an idea of \u201cvirility\u201d \u2013 in its original Greek sense of acting with virtue, of living with grace and due responsibility \u2013 it will, she argues, not be done by hashtags alone. \u201cOur age often promotes, inculcates and celebrates infantilism and complaint,\u201d she writes; #KillAllMen will get women \u2013 and men \u2013 nowhere.\n\nAnother book, on a similar subject, from the same publisher, is not quite so convinced. Ivan Jablonka\u2019s history of masculinity became something of a surprise bestseller in France. Jablonka adopts a much wider lens in analysing the problem with men, one that begins in the division of labour in paleolithic societies and runs through the ultimate mansplaining prophets of the Abrahamic religions to take in pop music lyrics and English boarding schools. \u201cOnce the end of men has been diagnosed,\u201d Jablonka writes, in spirited translation, \u201cmen can be reinvented as fair and just.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to his long prehistory, men, he believes, are suddenly \u201ccapable of renouncing the brawny male, the brute, the swine in us. And when we have made cracks in the masculinities of domination, out of them will come human beings rid of their little game of virility.\u201d Jablonka presents himself as a humble conduit for that revolution. \u201cWhat am I doing here, amid the feminist struggle?\u201d he wonders, \u201cis it possible to fight the patriarchy as a man?\u201d His 354 pages make the profoundly confident Gallic case for that new humility \u2013 but Nina Power\u2019s slimmer volume makes a much more urgent claim to any spare man hours."}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about the supersonic jet?\n\nA Chinese company is developing a supersonic jet capable of traveling from New York to China in just one hour (via Robb Report). The company behind the jet is Space Transportation. It says that it is developing a \u201crocket with wings\u201d, which will work for space tourism and point-to-point travel.\n\nSpace Transportation says that its jet will be lower cost than the rockets that are used to carry satellites into space. It will also be much faster than traditional planes.\n\nTo showcase the speed it hopes to achieve, Space Transportation has included a video on its website. In the video, several passengers climb aboard the supersonic jet. The jet then turns vertically towards the sky and launches into the air. After several seconds of flight, the launch boosters fall away, returning safely to the launch pad where they can be used again later.\n\nThe jet then continues its trek through the clouds and its suborbital journey, eventually traveling 7,000KM to its destination in the span of 60 minutes. The craft shown in the video is impressive, and the speed at which it travels is even more impressive.\n\nSpace Transport plans to run ground tests by 2023. It hopes to commence a first flight of the supersonic jet in 2024, and a crewed flight later in 2025. These plans are ambitious, but the company isn\u2019t stopping there. It also says that it hopes to run a test flight of a crewed space vehicle by 2030."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 important facts from the information below?\n\nPolar bears are stocky, with a long neck, relatively small head, short, rounded ears, and a short tail. The male, which is much larger than the female, weighs 410 to 720 kg (900 to 1,600 pounds). It grows to about 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) tall at the shoulder and 2.2\u20132.5 metres in length. The tail is 7\u201312 cm (3\u20135 inches) long. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear\u2019s black skin. Under the skin is a layer of insulating fat. The broad feet have hairy soles to protect and insulate as well as to facilitate movement across ice, as does the uneven skin on the soles of the feet, which helps to prevent slipping. Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey.\n\nPolar bears are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds. The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born. Polar bears prefer ice that is subject to periodic fracturing by wind and sea currents, because these fractures offer seals access to both air and water. As their prey is aquatic, polar bears are excellent swimmers, and they are even known to kill beluga whales. In swimming, the polar bear uses only its front limbs, an aquatic adaptation found in no other four-legged mammal. Polar bears are opportunistic as well as predatory: they will consume dead fish and carcasses of stranded whales and eat garbage near human settlements.\n\nMating occurs in spring, and implantation of the fertilized ovum is delayed. Including the delay, gestation may last 195\u2013265 days, and one to four cubs, usually two, are born during the winter in a den of ice or snow. Cubs weigh less than 1 kg at birth and are not weaned until after they are two years old. Young polar bears may die of starvation or may be killed by adult males, and for this reason female polar bears are extremely defensive of their young when adult males are present. Young remain with their mothers until they reach sexual maturity. Females first reproduce at four to eight years of age and breed every two to four years thereafter. Males mature at about the same age as females but do not breed until a few years later. Adult polar bears have no natural predators, though walruses and wolves can kill them. Longevity in the wild is 25 to 30 years, but in captivity several polar bears have lived to more than 35 years old."}

{"prompt": "Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson (/\u02c8f\u025bf\u0259l/;[5] born 19 June 1964) is a British politician serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party and has been since 2019. He was Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2018 and Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. Johnson has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015 and was previously MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008.\n\nJohnson attended Eton College and read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford. He was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1986. In 1989, he became the Brussels correspondent, and later political columnist, for The Daily Telegraph, and was editor of The Spectator magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected to Parliament in 2001, Johnson was a shadow minister under Conservative leaders Michael Howard and David Cameron. In 2008, he was elected Mayor of London and resigned from the House of Commons; he was re-elected as mayor in 2012. In the 2015 election, Johnson was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. The following year, he did not seek re-election as mayor. He became a prominent figure in the successful Vote Leave campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union (EU) membership referendum. Theresa May appointed him foreign secretary after the referendum; he resigned the position two years later in protest at May's approach to Brexit and the Chequers Agreement.\n\nAfter May resigned in 2019, Johnson was elected Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. He re-opened Brexit negotiations and in early September controversially prorogued Parliament; the Supreme Court ruled the action unlawful later that month.[b] After agreeing to a revised Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU, which replaced the Irish backstop with a new Northern Ireland Protocol, but failing to win parliamentary support for the agreement, Johnson called a snap election for December 2019 in which he led the Conservative Party to victory with 43.6 per cent of the vote, and the party's largest seat share since 1987. On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU, entering into a transition period and trade negotiations leading to the EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic became a major issue of his premiership; the government responded with various emergency powers, introduced measures across society to mitigate its impact, and approved the rollout of a nationwide vaccination programme. Johnson has been criticised for his slow response to the outbreak, including his resistance to introducing lockdown measures.[discuss][citation needed]\n\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics.[7][8] Supporters have praised him as humorous and entertaining,[9] with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters.[10][11] Conversely, his critics have accused him of lying, elitism, cronyism, and bigotry.[12][13][14] Commentators have described his political style as opportunistic, populist, or pragmatic.[15][16][17] - Remove all bracketed numbers from this text."}

The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, twins who were suckled by a she-wolf as infants.[1] Another account, set earlier in time, claims that the Roman people are descended from Trojan War hero Aeneas, who escaped to Italy after the war, and whose son, Iulus, was the ancestor of the family of Julius Caesar.[2] The archaeological evidence of human occupation of the area of modern-day Rome dates from about 14,000 years ago.["}

Even as we adjust and begin learning to navigate our post-COVID reality, you can count on it to still cause more significant shifts, especially in business.\nHow much more will the landscape change as we flux between opening up and lockdowns brought about by surges? How will these impact the trajectory of small businesses? How will they scale without teetering on the edge of closing?\nWith these insights, your business can be prepared for this coming year.\nIn the Philippines (as with the rest of the world), e-commerce is booming. \nDuring last December\u2019s Philippine Startup Week 2021, citing data from Google, Temasek, and Bain and Company, these key figures regarding the Philippines\u2019 e-commerce scene were reported:\n\u2022\t132% e-commerce growth in the past year;\n\u2022\tNew digital consumers are up to 12 million, and;\n\u2022\t99% of digital consumers are likely to continue using e-commerce.\nBut while those figures spell out hope for Philippine MSMEs, they also point out challenges. Small businesses can look forward to recovering from the blows of the pandemic but not without adequate support. \nTo start things off, there\u2019s an increasing concern about data privacy. In response to loudening calls for better data privacy protection online, tech giants are slowly rolling out their own restrictions for data tracking. \nApple, for instance, rolled out the iOS 14 security update that imposed restrictions on user data tracking by App Store publishers earlier this year. This was welcomed by users who are wary of data breaches as an added protective measure, so we may soon see similar updates rolling out from other tech companies.\nIn light of this, you\u2019ll have to reassess how well-equipped you are in safeguarding your organization\u2019s consumer data privacy and how transparent you are with these practices. Remember: A consumer that trusts you is one that will most likely convert.\nUltimately, protecting your customers\u2019 data privacy is non-negotiable in digital marketing \u2013 even if it comes at the cost of generating reports for your online marketing efforts. At the end of the day, resolving that issue is just a matter of optimizing your ad campaigns and finding creative and relevant ways to reach out to your existing customers."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia entry:\nGeology\nSequoia National Park contains a significant portion of the Sierra Nevada. The park's mountainous landscape includes the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, which rises to 14,505 feet (4,421 m) above sea level.[23] The Great Western Divide parallels the Sierran crest and is visible at various places in the park, for example, Mineral King, Moro Rock, and the Giant Forest. Peaks in the Great Western Divide rise to more than 12,000 feet (3,700 m). Deep canyons lie between the mountains, including Tokopah Valley above Lodgepole, Deep Canyon on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Kern Canyon in the park's backcountry, which is more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) deep for 30 miles (48 km).[24]\n\n\nGreat Western Divide from the summit of Mount Kaweah\nMost of the mountains and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are composed of granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed when molten rock cooled far beneath the surface of the earth. The molten rock was the result of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under the waters of the Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subducting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it proceeded. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have a speckled salt-and-pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas. Valhalla, or the Angel Wings, are prominent granitic cliffs that rise above the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River.[24]\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range, probably not more than 10 million years old. Forces in the earth, probably associated with the development of the Great Basin, forced the mountains to rise. During the last 10 million years, at least four ice ages have coated the mountains in a thick mantle of ice. Glaciers form and develop during long periods of cool and wet weather. Glaciers move very slowly through the mountains, carving deep valleys and craggy peaks. The extensive history of glaciation within the range and the erosion resistant nature of the granitic rocks that make up most of the Sierra Nevada have together created a landscape of hanging valleys, waterfalls, craggy peaks, alpine lakes and glacial canyons.[24]\n\n\nCalcite formations in Crystal Cave\nPark caves, like most caves in the Sierra Nevada of California, are mostly solutional caves dissolved from marble. Marble rock is essentially limestone that was metamorphosed by the heat and pressure of the formation and uplift of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The batholith's rapid uplift over the past 10 million years led to a rapid erosion of the metamorphic rocks in the higher elevations, exposing the granite beneath; therefore, most Sierra Nevada caves are found in the middle and lower elevations (below 7,000 ft or 2,100 m), though some caves are found in the park at elevations as high as 10,000 ft (3,000 m) such as the White Chief cave and Cirque Cave in Mineral King. These caves are carved out of the rock by the abundant seasonal streams in the park. Most of the larger park caves have, or have had, sinking streams running through them.\n\nThe park contains more than 270 known caves, including Lilburn Cave which is California's longest cave with nearly 17 miles (27 km) of surveyed passages.[24] The only commercial cave open to park visitors is Crystal Cave, the park's second-longest cave at over 3.4 miles (5.5 km). Crystal Cave was discovered on April 28, 1918, by Alex Medley and Cassius Webster.[25] The cave is a constant 48 \u00b0F (9 \u00b0C), and is only accessible by guided tour.\n\nCaves are discovered every year in the park with the most recently discovered major cave being Ursa Minor in August 2006.[26][27]"}

{"prompt": "How many way are there to celebrate achievement in the following post? So, how can you acknowledge and applaud success? Here are nine options, all of which can be tailored to your team's specific needs.\n\n1. Just say it. A straightforward, face-to-face \"well done\" is a simple but effective way to celebrate achievement. A personal email can be sufficient, too, and a handwritten card or note can add a valuable personal touch.\n\nGathering the team together to acknowledge success can be a powerful statement, and a round of applause can be uplifting and team-building \u2013 but take care not to embarrass anyone.\n\n2. Share success stories. A group message is another option. Tailor it to the specific person and their achievement, but don't overuse this method or it could come across as formulaic.\n\nYou can use email, the company newsletter, social media, or a messaging platform to share and celebrate success stories. You could even set up a dedicated channel to highlight and congratulate people for jobs well done. This has the added benefit of raising your team member's profile .\n\n3. Pay it forward. When you're celebrating an achievement of your own, show your gratitude by acknowledging the people who helped to make it happen. Always look out for opportunities to help other people to succeed, so that they have a reason to celebrate, too.\n\nAnd when team members share good news, always try to respond positively . Positive reinforcements further enhance team morale.\n\n4. Give a gift. A celebratory gift could be a one-off cash bonus, or a non-cash equivalent, such as a retail or experience voucher. Cash is often the most popular reward, but think very carefully about how other employees might perceive it. Bear in mind that some team members may already be incentivized with cash bonuses.\n\nTry to avoid setting a precedent: you don't want recognition to become just an impersonal cash transaction.\n\nGifts such as food or flowers are a relatively inexpensive yet powerful way of recognizing achievement. Make sure that you consider any dietary or allergy issues. There may also be cultural sensitivities around giving gifts that you should be aware of.\n\n5. Get together socially. Celebrating by buying team members a meal or drink can be an effective way to reward them and to boost team spirit. However, beware excluding anyone who, for example, is away on vacation, has special dietary requirements, or has caregiving responsibilities .\n\nIf you hold your event during the working day, be mindful of colleagues' deadlines and be clear about whether you expect them to return to work afterward.\n\n6. Organize a team day out. A trip to the movies, a meal at a restaurant, attending a sporting event, or even a day of outdoor activities are all common ways of celebrating. But there are potential risks to keep in mind, too.\n\nEveryone will likely have a different idea of \"fun,\" so try to find an activity that will be popular across the board. You won't want anyone to be unhappy or refuse to take part. This is a particular risk with physical or outdoor activities that might be difficult for some people, for health, accessibility or confidence reasons.\n\nOnce you've agreed on a suitable event, further questions to answer might be:\n\nWhat's included in the day at the company's expense?\nIs there anyone who'd find it hard to afford the other parts of the day?\nCan people bring family members?\nIf so, will those family members have to pay their own way?\nWhere does that leave colleagues who are single or without children?\n7. Offer extra holiday. Time off can be a great reward, especially when your team has worked extra hours to complete a project. But would working late occasionally for no particular reason also count as an achievement? Be careful about creating false expectations for the future.\n\n8. Set up a hall of fame. An \"employee of the week\" noticeboard or notification can be popular and effective, but it can lose impact over time.\n\nYou risk accusations of tokenism if you feel obliged to choose someone rather than no one, whether they deserve it or not. And if you keep recognizing a \"star\" team member, or constantly overlook another, you might start to alienate people.\n\n9. Have an awards ceremony. A glitzy evening of music, trophies and speeches is an exciting way to combine socializing, team building and networking with formal recognition and celebration.\n\nIf you have the budget, you can hire a venue and a professional events team. However, if you want to limit the expense and increase participation, get your team involved in managing and running the event, including making the food and costumes. This will be fun and rewarding in itself!\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Use your imagination and judgment to create your own celebrations \u2013 and see what happens to productivity and job satisfaction when your people feel celebrated and recognized for their work."}

{"prompt": "What paradox is this Wikipedia article referring to?\n\nIt is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:\nBut I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.[2]\n\nViktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning:\nHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\n\nThe more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.[3]\n\nPhilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901):\nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.\nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power increases\u2014that a resistance is overcome.[4]\n\n[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)[5]\n\nPsychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):\nNietzsche's \"will to power\" and \"will to seem\" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of F\u00e9r\u00e9 and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.[6]\n\nPoet and satirist Edward Young:\nThe love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,\nReigns more or less supreme in every heart;\nThe Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;\nThe modest shun it, but to make it sure![7]\n\nPolitician William Bennett:\nHappiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.[8][9]\n\nNovelist Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa:\nHappiness is found only in little moments of inattention."}

{"prompt": "What does this text say that hyenas eat?\n\nThese interesting carnivores live in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. They are able to survive in savannas and swamps, as well as semi-arid regions, and even mountainous forest areas. Rather than resting in dens, adult spotted hyenas sleep in holes or shallow pools or under bushes or scrubs\u2014anywhere they can find shade during the heat of the day. Hyenas use watering holes as places to cool off or to hide extra food. Spotted hyenas can be active both day and night, depending on their needs and whether there are humans around, but they are generally nocturnal.\n\nLions and hyenas compete over the same food in overlapping territories. Sometimes the hyenas do the work of organizing, chasing down, and killing prey only to have lions steal it. Lions often injure or kill hyenas as they fight over a carcass. Both hyenas and lions mark and establish territories, and both species are always on guard. When confronted by a lion, the spotted hyena calls for help from other hyenas.\n\nIn a large group, spotted hyenas are able to chase lions away from a kill. But during a hunt, the hyena's impressive hunting skills come into play. They are able to chase down prey over long distances while running at up to 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour). \n\nSpotted hyenas often pick out the young or weak from the herd, but they can kill even healthy adult ungulates. What they hunt depends on numbers. The bigger the hyena clan, the larger its prey. This can include young rhinos, adult wildebeest, zebras, and Cape buffalo. The hyenas work in a group when hunting such large prey, and young hyenas take years to become successful. Smaller packs chase down gazelles, impalas, warthogs, and waterbucks.\n\nWhen hunting alone, a spotted hyena may go after smaller prey. Ground birds, rabbits, springhare, bat-eared foxes, porcupines, jackals, and fish can be on the menu. Even ostrich eggs are fair game! Spotted hyenas also scavenge, but they have to compete with jackals and vultures for these leftovers.\n\nA hyena can eat quite a bit at one time. Sometimes, leftovers are buried in a mud hole for a later meal. Spotted hyenas give new meaning to the phrase \"lick the platter clean.\" They eat practically every part of their prey, including skin, hooves, bone, and teeth. Powerful jaws are able to crush bones with ease. Most other predators couldn\u2019t eat those things, even if they tried. There are some items that hyenas can\u2019t digest, such as hair and horns, although they still eat them."}

{"prompt": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts used to imagine what what it might be like to have Freddie Freeman on his side.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to wonder anymore.\n\nAll the speculation about Freeman joining the Dodgers went from rumor to real when the five-time All-Star, former Atlanta Braves first baseman and free agent agreed to a six-year deal worth $162 million late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOn paper, it\u2019s a great lineup, as good as any I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said Thursday.\n\nFreeman was expected to arrive in camp Friday, a day after he underwent a physical in Los Angeles.\n\nRoberts\u2019 bold optimism was echoed throughout the Dodgers\u2019 clubhouse. In Freeman, the Dodgers said they have another star, a fourth former MVP on their 2022 roster. His left-handed bat figures to fill a hole left when Corey Seager signed with the Texas Rangers in late November.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a position player in a lineup of all All-Stars,\u2019\u2019 said pitcher Clayton Kershaw, a former MVP along with teammates Mookie Betts and Cody Bellinger. \u201cWith what Freddie brings, he\u2019s got to be, if not the best, a top three or four hitter in the game.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the hitting, Roberts says the 32-year-old Freeman will create more options in the field.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t exactly project what the lineup will be right now,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said. \u201cBut this roster was already very versatile. Now, there\u2019s so much more we can do with somebody who is already one of the premier hitters in the game.\"\n\n\u201cNow, we should grind teams, go deep into the \u2018pens. We should score runs,\u201d e said.\n\nInfielder Justin Turner was happy to have a player he knew from his days as a kid in Southern California. Freeman grew up in Orange County and Turner is from Long Beach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Freddie for a long time,\u2019\u2019 Turner said. \u201cWe grew up playing together. I\u2019ve been recruiting him to the Dodgers for the last five years.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, and that\u2019s probably an understatement. Obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of buildup and a lot of talk and a lot of anticipation as to what was going to happen. To finally see it go down and be official was \u2013\u2013 I slept really good,\" he said.\n\nFreeman hit .300 with 31 homers and 83 RBIs last season.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s always been a great hitter. Add him to our lineup, and it could be ridiculous, to be honest. He knows how to drive in runs. That\u2019s an art form. It\u2019s not something you learn overnight, he said.\n\nFreeman, an Angels fan as a kid, helped eliminate the Dodgers in last year\u2019s NL Championship Series. The Braves went on to win the World Series, beating the Houston Astros in six games.\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t talk to him then.\n\n\u201cI was too angry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nRoberts waited to speak to Freeman in a call with Dodgers baseball operation president Andrew Friedman just before the lockout started on Dec. 2.\n\n\u201cFor him to take the call from me and Andrew, pre-lockout, showed me that his interest was sincere,\u2019\u2019 Roberts said.\n\nFor the Dodgers to close the deal, Kershaw said, is another example of why the franchise continues to be successful.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent money,\" said Kershaw, who signed a one-year deal to stay with the Dodgers last Friday, ending speculation that he might jump to the Rangers. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone and done it. Some years have been a little different than others.\"\n\n\u201cBut I would say the majority of the time they (owners) have been pretty consistent with their actions and proving to us that they really want to do whatever it takes to win,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for that. It\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to come back. You still see what\u2019s going on with other teams right now so it\u2019s just even more of a reason to be happy to be here.\u201d\n\nCan you give me 2 concise bullet points?"}

Taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony is an emotional moment for many immigrants, and for good reason: it is the culmination of an often arduous process and many years of striving. Citizenship also opens a new chapter marked by possibility, from better job prospects to full participation in civic life.\n\nYet for many immigrants who aspire to become U.S. citizens, that moment never arrives. Since the 1970s, naturalization rates in the United States have lagged behind those of other major host countries. It\u2019s a striking disparity given that the vast majority of immigrants in the United States express interest in citizenship. And since gaining citizenship often boosts immigrants\u2019 social mobility and integration, the fact that so many are left behind points to a troubling loss of solidarity for their host communities.\n\nWhat holds them back? Why are some immigrants more likely than others to complete the naturalization process?\n\nIPL research provides the first concrete evidence of a major barrier to citizenship for low-income immigrants. The findings help explain why citizenship-promotion efforts face significant challenges, and they provide a blueprint for solutions to ensure that all immigrants have equal access to citizenship and its benefits.\n\nA Life-Changing Program\nIn seeking to understand disparities in naturalization patterns, previous studies have focused on the immigrants themselves\u2014individual characteristics like language skills, resources, or country of origin. Here, the researchers considered an external factor out of immigrants\u2019 control: the high costs of the citizenship application process.\n\nFor many low-income immigrants, the price tag is daunting: $725 just to file the application, plus hundreds or even thousands more if you need English classes or consultations with immigration lawyers. Charitable organizations have stepped up to provide free language training, legal advice, and help navigating the paperwork. But the application fee has only become more burdensome, rising by 800 percent in real terms since 1985, when it was $35 (or $80.25 in today\u2019s dollars). The federal government offers a fee waiver for the poorest immigrants\u2014those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line\u2014but for many others who aren\u2019t destitute but struggle to make ends meet, that fee alone can put citizenship out of reach.\n\nTo address this potentially pivotal financial obstacle, IPL teamed up with the New York State Office for New Americans (ONA) and two funders dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable New Yorkers, Robin Hood and New York Community Trust. Together we developed an innovative, public-private program called NaturalizeNY, which offers low-income immigrants an opportunity to win a voucher covering the naturalization application fee.\n\nVeyom Bahl, a managing director at Robin Hood, said, \u201cRobin Hood is proud to partner with the world-class researchers at the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab. Like us, they are committed to helping immigrant families build a strong footing for a new life in the United States. This research will help foundations, community-based organizations, and policymakers alike re-think how we invest in our communities for maximum impact.\u201d\n\nNaturalizeNY also connects registrants with application assistance from ONA\u2019s network of nonprofit service providers. New York\u2019s leading immigrant service organizations, including CUNY Citizenship Now!, Hispanic Federation, and Catholic Charities, were also integral in promoting and implementing the program.\n\n\u201cThis was a truly first-of-a-kind program, where a state agency, philanthropies, academics, and nonprofits created a way to provide direct financial support to help low-income immigrants apply for citizenship. The Immigration Policy Lab was excited to partner in its design and evaluation so everyone involved could understand its impact on immigrants and the New York community,\u201d said Michael Hotard, an IPL program manager."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article for me?   The trade that brought quarterback Matthew Stafford to Los Angeles last year was a fresh start for both player and team. The former No. 1 pick desperately needed a change in scenery after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff at QB. But Stafford and his new team were already running out of time: The Rams had traded away numerous future draft picks with a single-minded focus on winning right now, while their new QB had just turned 33 \u2014 with a lot of extra mileage \u2014 days after the trade was announced. With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.\n\nFortunately for the Rams, it didn\u2019t \u2014 and now Stafford and company are a win over the Cincinnati Bengals away from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Stafford\u2019s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career Approximate Value (AV) of 133 had already far exceeded the number we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick (73). Back in 2011, the so-called Year of the Quarterback, Stafford was front and center, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season had ever seen such prolific passing. (Stafford remains one of just six QBs to surpass 5,000 yards and 40 touchdown passes in a single season.) Over his career, Stafford was easily the winningest quarterback in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL\u2019s oldest teams, and the second-best player in franchise history according to AV \u2014 trailing only the incomparable Barry Sanders.\n\nBut although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit \u2014 its only three postseason berths this century \u2014 the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions\u2019 defense was largely ineffective during Stafford\u2019s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team\u2019s offense was also surprisingly mediocre \u2014 scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.\n\nThat all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the second-best performance of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, second-best (in a tie) by AV, third-best by QB value over replacement, fourth-best by Total Quarterback Rating and fourth-best by Football Outsiders\u2019 Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay\u2019s offense that Goff couldn\u2019t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn\u2019t perfect in his Rams debut \u2014 he tied for the league lead in interceptions, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff\u2019s last year (2.4 percent) \u2014 he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.\n\nStafford also performed much better under pressure \u2014 both literal and metaphorical \u2014 which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.\u2019s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL\u2019s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff\u2019s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage \u2014 he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year \u2014 opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay\u2019s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats, than Stafford did.\n\nStafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL\u2019s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams\u2019 offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted expected points added (EPA) per game \u2014 and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically \u2014 last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.\n\nSuch second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,1 much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a few important details from this article?\n\nThe count of confirmed exoplanets just ticked past the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA space telescopes.\n\nNot so long ago, we lived in a universe with only a small number of known planets, all of them orbiting our Sun. But a new raft of discoveries marks a scientific high point: More than 5,000 planets are now confirmed to exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe planetary odometer turned on March 21, with the latest batch of 65 exoplanets \u2013 planets outside our immediate solar family \u2013 added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The archive records exoplanet discoveries that appear in peer-reviewed, scientific papers, and that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods or by analytical techniques.\n\nThe 5,000-plus planets found so far include small, rocky worlds like Earth, gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, and \u201chot Jupiters\u201d in scorchingly close orbits around their stars. There are \u201csuper-Earths,\u201d which are possible rocky worlds bigger than our own, and \u201cmini-Neptunes,\u201d smaller versions of our system\u2019s Neptune. Add to the mix planets orbiting two stars at once and planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a number,\u201d said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. \u201cEach one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u201d\n\nWe do know this: Our galaxy likely holds hundreds of billions of such planets. The steady drumbeat of discovery began in 1992 with strange new worlds orbiting an even stranger star. It was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar, a rapidly spinning stellar corpse that pulses with millisecond bursts of searing radiation. Measuring slight changes in the timing of the pulses allowed scientists to reveal planets in orbit around the pulsar.\n\nFinding just three planets around this spinning star essentially opened the floodgates, said Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system.\n\n\u201cIf you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\u201d Wolszczan said. \u201cThe planet production process has to be very robust.\u201d\n\nWolszczan, who still searches for exoplanets as a professor at Penn State, says we\u2019re opening an era of discovery that will go beyond simply adding new planets to the list. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, continues to make new exoplanet discoveries. But soon powerful next-generation telescopes and their highly sensitive instruments, starting with the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, will capture light from the atmospheres of exoplanets, reading which gases are present to potentially identify tell-tale signs of habitable conditions.\n\nThe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, expected to launch in 2027, will make new exoplanet discoveries using a variety of methods. The ESA (European Space Agency) mission ARIEL, launching in 2029, will observe exoplanet atmospheres; a piece of NASA technology aboard, called CASE, will help zero in on exoplanet clouds and hazes.\n\n\u201cTo my thinking, it is inevitable that we\u2019ll find some kind of life somewhere \u2013 most likely of some primitive kind,\u201d Wolszczan said. The close connection between the chemistry of life on Earth and chemistry found throughout the universe, as well as the detection of widespread organic molecules, suggests detection of life itself is only a matter of time, he added."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this synopsis of \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 2 paragraphs or less? \n\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander's wife while singing \"Singin' in the Rain\". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer, PR Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning Alex and leaving him to be arrested. Deltoid brings word that the woman has died of her injuries, and Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is released from prison, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who is now using a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted his wife and him. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping out the window.\n\nAlex survives the attempt and wakes up in hospital with multiple injuries. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty."}

{"prompt": "Can you use this text to tell me 3 facts about foxes?\n\nFoxes are omnivorous mammals that are light on their feet. They are often mistaken for other members of the Canidae family, which include jackals, wolves and dogs. They stand out from their relatives because of their long, thin legs, lithe frame, pointed nose and bushy tail.\n\nThese animals are very social and live flexible lives. They are found all over the world \u2014 in North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa \u2014 and call a wide range of terrains their home. They also eat a greatly varied diet.\n\nSize\nMost foxes are around the same size as medium-sized dogs. Since foxes are smaller mammals, they are also quite light. They can weigh as little as 1.5 lbs. (680 grams) and as much as 24 lbs. (11 kg). The fennec fox is the smallest living fox and doesn't get any bigger than a cat \u2014 about 9 inches (23 centimeters) and weighing 2.2 to 3.3 lbs. (1 to 1.5 kilograms), according to National Geographic. Other species can grow to 34 inches (86 cm) from their head to their flanks. Their tails can add an additional 12 to 22 inches (30 to 56 cm) to their length. \n\nHabitat\nFoxes usually live in forested areas, though they are also found in mountains, grasslands and deserts. They make their homes by digging burrows in the ground. These burrows, also called dens, provide a cool area to sleep, a good location to store food and a safe place to have their pups. Burrows are dug-out tunnels that have rooms for the fox and its family to live in. The burrows also have several exits so that they can flee if a predator enters the burrow.\n\nHabits\nFoxes are very social creatures that live in packs. A group of foxes are called a leash, skulk or earth, according to the U.S. Department of Interior. They are also called packs. No matter what you call them, foxes like to stick near family members. A pack may include older siblings, foxes of breeding age, mates and mothers. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, and females are called vixens.\n\nThese mammals like to hunt at night and are nocturnal. This means that they sleep during the day. This can change, though, depending on where the fox pack lives. If they live in a place where they feel safe, a fox pack may hunt during the daytime, according to National Parks and Wildlife Service of Ireland.\n\nFoxes have great eyesight. They can see just as well as a cat, in fact. Their eyes are much like a cat's thanks to their vertically slit pupils.\n\nFoxes are also very fast. They can run up to 45 mph (72 km/h). That is almost as fast as the blackbuck antelope, one of the world's fastest animals.\n\nDiet\nFoxes are omnivores. This means that they eat meat and vegetation. A fox's diet can consist of small animals, such as lizards, voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. They round out their diet with birds, fruits and bugs, according to the Smithsonian. Foxes that live near the ocean eat fish and crabs, as well. If they have trouble finding food, a fox will have no problem raiding trash cans to find scraps.\n\nFoxes can eat up to several pounds of food a day. What they don't eat, they often bury under leaves or snow for later.\n\nOffspring\nFox babies are called pups. During mating season, the female will cry out to let males know that she is ready. After mating, females will make a nest of leaves inside her burrow on which to have her pups. This special room in the burrow is called a nesting chamber.\n\nThe pregnant female only carries her pups for a gestation period of 53 days. There are usually two to seven pups in a litter. Pup care is a family affair. Both the mother and father share the care of pups. Even older siblings will help take care of their younger brother and sisters by bringing them food.\n\nFoxes live very short lives in the wild. They often live only around three years, according to the Animal Diversity Web. In captivity, they can live much longer. Foxes in zoos, for example, can live 10 to 12 years."}

Can you give me a summary of what it actually says? \"Ancient Japanese 'killing stone' said to contain an evil demon splits apart sending superstitious believers into a state of panic\nThe stone is located in the mountainous region of Tochigi, north of Tokyo, Japan\nAccording to mythology, it contains the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae\nHer true identity was said to be an evil nine-tailed fox embedded into the stone\nThe stone split in two parts and was discovered by tourists over the weekend. An ancient Japanese 'killing stone' which is said to contain an evil demon that will kill anyone who comes into contact with it has split in two, sending superstitious believers into a state of panic.\n\nThe stone is located in the mountainous region of Tochigi, north of Tokyo, where visitors were given a shock over the weekend when they found it separated into two roughly similar sized parts, reports the Guardian. \n\nAccording to mythology, the famous piece of volcanic rock, called the Sessho-seki, contains the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman whose true identity was said to have been an evil nine-tailed fox.\n\n\nLegend has it Tamamo-no-Mae was part of a plot to kill Emperor Toba who ruled Japan from 1107 to 1123.\n\nThe spirit was then said to have been embedded into the stone where it would kill anyone who came into contact with it.  It has been said that the rock was destroyed many years ago and a Buddhist monk exorcised the spirit from it before scattering it across Japan.\n\nHowever, many Japanese people said it was always located on the slopes of Mount Nasu and that its evil spirit may have been resurrected, releasing a poisonous gas, after it was found split in two by tourists over the weekend. \n\n'I feel like I\u2019ve seen something that shouldn\u2019t be seen', said one tourist who tweeted about the discovery on Saturday.\n\nAnother feared the release of an evil demon was just the latest horror of 2022, while one user joked that the spirit would want to spend another millennium stuck inside the rock after looking at the current state of the world. \n\nLocal media reported that the stone is likely to have split in half after rainwater seeped into cracks which first appeared several years ago, causing it to break. Masaharu Sugawara, who leads a local volunteer guide group, told Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun the split was a 'shame' because it was a popular tourist attraction for the area.\n\nHowever, he agreed that rainwater was the likely cause of the split.\n\nThe Shimotsuke Shimbun newspaper reported that local and national government officials will decide what happens to the stone now, with one official saying he would like it returned to its original form. \""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nWho Is Julia Kristeva?\n\nJulia Kristeva is a name that often gets bounced around in conversations about contemporary theory and philosophy. But who, exactly, is Kristeva, and why is she so important? Born in Bulgaria in 1941, she moved to France at the age of 23, and here she became a leader in philosophy, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Her writing has encompassed various subjects including sociology, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and art history. She has also published more than 30 books and leading scholarly essays, and been awarded a series of prestigious prizes including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize. Let\u2019s take a look at her life and work in more detail.\n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leader In Semiotics\n\nThroughout her career, Kristeva has pursued the subject of semiotics, or the study of signs, symbols and language. She trained in linguistics at the University of Sofia, before moving to France in the 1960s. In France, Kristeva became a member of the Tel Quel group, a band of French academics who published the literary journal Tel Quel. The journal gave Kristeva a platform to explore ideas around the politics of language. \n\nTwo of Her Most Important Early Publications Explored Semiotics\n\nKristeva\u2019s early work with Tel Quel became the foundation for her first two publications, Semeiotik\u00e8 (1969) and La R\u00e9volution du langage po\u00e9tique (The Revolution of Poetic Language) (1974). These texts drew on Freudian, Lacanian, and Kleinian psychoanalysis, examining how language, culture and ideologies are built out of unconscious body and gender-based dimensions. Further training in psychoanalysis in the 1970s deepened Kristeva\u2019s belief that unconscious emotions and feelings are intertwined with the meaning invested into our forms of communication.\n\n \n\nAfter the Birth of Her Son, Julia Kristeva Became Increasingly Interested In Child Psychology\n\nFollowing the birth of her son in the 1970s, Kristeva began exploring the semiotic link between mother and child. Her iconic text of this period was Pouvoirs de l\u2019horreur (Powers of Horror) (1980/1982), which explored the power struggle between mother and child as the child eventually rejects their mother in order to find themselves. She calls this rejection of the mother \u201cabjection\u201d, and she believed her notion of the abject would come to replay throughout the human\u2019s adult life in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nKristeva Wrote About the Role of Abjection In Adulthood\n\nSome of Kristeva\u2019s most graphic and disturbing writing explains how we experience the \u201cabject\u201d as adults. She outlines the kinds of horrible, unappealing objects, smells or experiences we naturally reject, such as milk-skin, fingernail clippings, dead bodies, human waste and so on... Not the most enjoyable read. But it does give us a fascinating insight into the workings of the human mind, and the way we respond to external stimuli outside our own body. \n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leading Feminist\n\nAmong her many achievements, Kristeva has been recognized as a leader in feminist theory. She has written extensively about women\u2019s bodies, particularly in relation to motherhood, and the role they play as a primal source of rhythm, tone and movement for every human being before it comes into the real world. One of her most important feminist essays is Women\u2019s Time (1979). In this work she argues there are three types of feminism. The first, which seeks universal equality, overlooking any sexual differences. The second phase emphasizes a uniquely feminine language, which she ultimately disregards as impossible, because she believes gender is too diverse to easily categorize. The third phase of Kristeva\u2019s feminism explores multiple identities, suggesting there are as many different kinds of sexualities are there are people. It\u2019s a fascinating theory that is particularly relevant for today\u2019s culture, which has opened up many debates about the complexities of gender, sexuality and identity."}

The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, twins who were suckled by a she-wolf as infants.[1] Another account, set earlier in time, claims that the Roman people are descended from Trojan War hero Aeneas, who escaped to Italy after the war, and whose son, Iulus, was the ancestor of the family of Julius Caesar.[2] The archaeological evidence of human occupation of the area of modern-day Rome dates from about 14,000 years ago.["}

{"prompt": "Can you explain to me how jail works in Monopoly?\n\nThe rules of Monopoly are not difficult, but they are specific. Monopoly can be played by 2+ players, depending on the number of player tokens available.\n\n\nMonopoly requires a special board, 32 houses, 12 hotels, Chance and Community Chest cards, Title Deed cards for each property, play money, player tokens, and two six-sided dice.\n\nEach player chooses a token and places it on \u2018Go\u2019, and is provided with $1500 as follows: 2 of each $500\u2019s, $100\u2019s, and $50\u2019s; 6 $20\u2019s; and 5 of each $10\u2019s, $5\u2019s, and $1\u2019s. One player is the Banker. All assets of the Bank should be separate from the Banker\u2019s own assets. The Bank controls all remaining money and all properties and buildings until they are purchased. The Bank can never \u2018go broke\u2019 \u2013 more money should be made if needed.\nGame Play\nAccording to the rules of Monopoly, the player that roles the highest total on both dice goes first. Game play proceeds clockwise from that player.\n\nThere are 4 main parts to a turn.\n1) Roll the dice. Move the number of squares indicated. If you throw doubles, you take another turn after your turn is completed. Each time you pass \u2018Go\u2019, collect $200 from the Bank.\n\n2) Buy properties. You may buy any property from the Bank that you land on if it is not already owned. If you do not purchase the property, the Banker auctions the property to the highest bidder.\n\nSome people chose not to use auctions, only allowing properties to be purchased as they are landed on.\n\n3) Building. You may only build when you own all properties in a color group. Building must be equal on all properties in a group. You may place a single building on a single property, but you may not place two buildings on one property unless all other properties in the group have one building present (even build rule). Any property can have a total of 4 houses, except Utilities and Railroads, which cannot be devloped. To place a hotel on a property, 4 houses must be present on all properties in the group. Houses are removed from the property when a hotel is placed. All buildings are purchased from the Bank.\n\n4) Complete necessary actions. Pay rent as determined by the Title Deed for the property you are on. Pay Income Tax to the Bank ($200 or 10% of your total assets). Draw a Community Chest or Chance card and follow the instructions. These cards are returned to the bottom of the pile when the action is completed.\n\nGoing to Jail\n\nIn the rules of Monopoly, there are 3 ways to be sent to \u2018Jail\u2019:\n\n1) Land on a space marked \u2018Go to Jail\u2019\n2) Draw a card marked \u2018Go to Jail\u2019\n3) Roll doubles three times in a row\n\nThere are 4 ways to get out of \u2018Jail\u2019\n\n1) Pay the $50 fine before rolling the dice\n2) Use a \u2018Get Out Of Jail Free Card\u2019 before rolling the dice\n3) Roll doubles\n4) After the 3rd failed attempt to roll doubles, you must pay the $50 fine and leave jail\n\nWhen you get out of \u2018Jail\u2019, move the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Even while in \u2018Jail\u2019, you may buy and sell property and collect any rent owed to you. You are not sent to \u2018Jail\u2019 if you land on the \u2018Jail\u2019 square during normal game play, and you do not incur a fine.\n\nMoney to Pay Rent, etc\n\nThe rules of Monopoly state, if you do not have enough money to pay Rent or other obligations during your turn, you may chose to sell houses, hotels, or property. Buildings may be sold to the Bank for one-half of the purchase price. Buildings may not be sold to other players. Unimproved properties (including railroad and utilities) can be sold to any player for any amount.\n\nUnimproved properties can also be mortgaged to the Bank for the value mortgage value printed on the Title Deed. No rent is collected on mortgaged properties. To lift a mortgage, the player must pay the Bank the mortgage amount plus 10% interest. Players retain possession of mortgaged properties. If that player chooses, he or she may sell the mortgaged property to another player for any price. The property would remain mortgaged, and the new owner would have to pay the Bank the same mortgage + 10% to lift the mortgage.\n\nWinning the Game\n\nYou may chose to end the game at any time and tally the total worth of each player (including buildings and all property worth). You may also chose to play until all but one player has been declared Bankrupt. Bankruptcy occurs when a player owes more than he or she can pay. You must turn over all that you have including money and Title Deeds to the Bank or another player, depending on who the current debt is owed to. Any player who has declared Bankruptcy is no longer part of the game. According to the rules of Monopoly, the last player in the game, or the player with the most money, wins."}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

I don't have the attention span to read it all. \"Russian forces have seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, and are holding staff hostage, according to Ukranian officials.\n\nTroops overran the plant on the first day of Russia\u2019s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine, a spokesperson for the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, Yevgeniya Kuznetsov\u0430, told CNN.\n\nAlyona Shevtsova, advisor to the commander of Ukraine\u2019s Ground Forces, said on Facebook that Russian forces have taken control of the power station and that the staff are being \u201cheld hostage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, control of the Chornobyl zone was lost after a \u201cfierce battle.\u201d\n\nPodolyak said the condition of the former Chernobyl power plant\u2019s nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown.\n\n\u201cAfter a completely senseless Russian attack in this direction, it is impossible to say that Chernobyl is safe,\u201d Podolyak added. \u201cThis is one of the most serious threats to Europe today.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Thursday said it was outraged over \u201ccredible reports\u201d that Russian soldiers are holding staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage.\n\n\u201cThis unlawful and dangerous hostage taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and greatly concerning,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in a Thursday evening briefing.\n\n\u201cWe condemn it and we request their release.\u201d Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russian forces were attempting to wrest control of the nuclear plant.\n\nWarnings over Russian moves\n\u201cRussian occupation forces are trying to seize the Chernobyl (nuclear power plant). Our defenders are sacrificing their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,\u201d Zelensky tweeted.\u201dThis is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry echoed the President\u2019s warning, raising the specter of another nuclear disaster in the city.\n\n\u201cIn 1986, the world saw the biggest technological disaster in Chernobyl,\u201d the ministry tweeted. \u201cIf Russia continues the war, Chernobyl can happen again in 2022.\u201d More than 30 people died in the immediate aftermath of an explosion that tore through Chernobyl\u2019s No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, near Pripyat, Ukraine. In the years that followed, countless others died from radiation symptoms, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization. The Ukraine government evacuated some 135,000 people from the area and the 19-mile exclusion zone around the plant will remain uninhabitable for decades.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv  on February 24, 2022. - Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a \"full-scale invasion\" was underway. \nIn the months after the accident, a sarcophagus was built to cover Reactor 4 and contain the radioactive material. However, it has since deteriorated, resulting in radiation leaks.\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine before dawn Thursday with a series of missile attacks against locations near the capital Kyiv, as well as long-range artillery against the city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border. The assault quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine as Russian forces attacked the country from three sides."}

{"prompt": "A Georgia teacher has been suspended after an altercation with a student who brought a gun to school in August 2021.\n\nThe disciplinary action stems from when former Coach Kenneth Miller said he received a video showing guns on Tri-Cities High School grounds, in East Point, according to WSB.\n\nOn their way to an outdoor pep rally that day, the school officials got notice that students were \u201cplanning on doing something,\u201d Miller told Fox News.\n\nHe said the school\u2019s principal asked him to investigate reports that students had brought guns to campus, the outlet reported.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney, Allen Lightcap, said that Miller was asking the student where the guns were when she attacked him. Shortly after the altercation, he said Miller found the gun she brought.\n\nVideo from an officer\u2019s body cam shows that when he went to the student to confront her, the student was agitated and smacked Miller\u2019s hand. He proceeded to push the student against the wall and restrained her until police intervened.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller is the reason all of metro Atlanta does not know the date of August 20, 2021,\u201d Lightcap told McClatchy News in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s because he averted another tragic school shooting that day, and no one was hurt. Everyone went home safe. Coach Miller is the reason these guns were found.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Fulton County School District originally filed a termination charge against Miller, Lightcap said.\n\nThe Fulton County school district told McClatchy News in a statement that Miller \u201cfailed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations.\u201d\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney said his client had \u201cthe right to self defense\u201d in this incident.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true when guns are involved,\u201d Lightcap said in the statement. \u201cTeachers should not be terminated or suspended when it\u2019s clear they were defending themselves.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials scheduled a termination hearing in the case. But Lightcap said the hearing was then \u201cabruptly canceled by the District without Coach Miller\u2019s consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the district has changed its charge to a suspension mid-trial, Coach Miller no longer gets to call witnesses so that the truth can come out,\u201d Lightcap said.In a letter from Ethel Lett, the high school\u2019s principal, shared on the school\u2019s website, Lett said that \u201cbringing a gun or weapon onto a school campus\u201d is a \u201cvery serious offense,\u201d in \u201cclear violation of our Fulton County Schools\u2019 Student Code of Conduct.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the principal announced that the school is exploring steps such as unannounced K-9 dog sweeps and random weapons checks.\n\nMiller received the notice of suspension on March 4. On March 9, Lightcap appealed the 20-day suspension, according to legal documents.\n\nIn the appeal, Lightcap reiterated that Miller \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that he \u201cdefended himself against a student who attacked him.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Officer] Cleveland and [AP] Lawson corroborated Miller\u2019s account that [the student] was the aggressor, was highly agitated, and smacked the phone out of Miller\u2019s hand,\u201d the Personal Investigation Report made on Sept. 13, 2021 said, according to Lightcap.\n\nLightcap wrote in the appeal that the investigation report said all three eye witnesses said they did not witness any misconduct by Miller. But, the attorney added that Fulton Board policies \u201cspecifically exclude witness testimony\u201d when it comes to suspensions versus full terminations.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller asks that the Fulton County drop the suspension and put him back to work at Tri-Cities,\u201d Lightcap said, \u201cIt is never too late to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTeacher caught using racial slur on video is teaching again in North Carolina\n\nTeacher suspended after parents said he taught \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 to Virginia class\n\nHigh school teacher shown in video slapping student is now arrested, Indiana cops say\n\nParent assaulted school resource officer, then drove away, North Carolina cops say     Can you write this in a more concise and professional way?"}

{"prompt": "List the director and awards won - The soundtrack for the 2018 American superhero film Black Panther, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and produced by Marvel Studios, consists of an original score composed by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson and original songs performed by Kendrick Lamar. G\u00f6ransson worked on all of director Ryan Coogler's previous films, while Lamar and Coogler had previously discussed collaborating and the musician agreed to perform several songs for the film after seeing an early version of it.\n\nAfter reading the film's script, G\u00f6ransson traveled to Africa to research traditional African music for the film. He went on tour with Senegalese musician Baaba Maal, and recorded performances by Maal and other African musicians for use in the score. Notably, G\u00f6ransson used recordings of talking drums and a tambin for character themes in the film, while Maal sung an original song for the opening of the score. G\u00f6ransson combined these traditional African elements with the classical orchestra that is often used in superhero films. The orchestra was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, along with a choir singing in the Xhosa language.\n\nWanting to match the film in terms of addressing important themes, Lamar decided to produce a full curated soundtrack album rather than just the few songs requested by Coogler. Because of the film's set release schedule, Lamar had less time to work on the album than he usually would. He began work with producer Sounwave while on tour, before completing the individual songs in collaboration with many different artists. One of these collaborators was G\u00f6ransson, who worked on one of the songs and included elements from the album in the score. Coogler felt the album became its own piece of art rather than just a tie-in to the film.\n\nLamar's soundtrack was released as Black Panther: The Album by Interscope Records on February 9, 2018, to large sales, including the top position on the Billboard 200 chart. It was praised by many critics as a milestone for film soundtracks due to its ideas and lyrics, but it was considered by some to be weaker than his solo work. G\u00f6ransson's score was released as Black Panther (Original Score) by Hollywood Records on February 16, and received praise for being unique among Marvel Cinematic Universe scores due to its authentic African elements and thematic material, though the album presentation was criticized as too long. It won Best Original Score awards at the Academy Awards and the Grammy Awards, while the song \"King's Dead\" from Lamar's album also won a Grammy."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary about removing a wasp's nest based on this article?\n\nEnsure that you are not allergic to wasp stings. If you're not sure whether you have an allergy to wasp stings or not, it's a good idea to set up an allergy test with your doctor before you attempt to tackle the nest.\nIf the test confirms that you are not allergic to stings, then you can proceed with getting rid of the nest by yourself.\nHowever, if you find out that you do have an allergy, you absolutely should ask someone else to deal with the nest or call an exterminator, as getting stung could be a life-threatening situation.\nContact your local vector control district. Though not available everywhere, vector control deals with disease-carrying or potentially dangerous insects and animals (vectors). These professionals can help you with identification, advise you on what to do, and may even remove the wasps for you.\nDo a quick internet search for \"vector control\" in your area to find contact information and request service.\nCall an exterminator. In most situations, it's best to leave nest removal to the professionals. If there is no vector control district or they are unable to come remove the nest, try an exterminator instead. This is especially true if you have ground-nesting yellow jackets.\nIf the wasp nest is in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, such as inside a wall or attic or underneath a concrete slab, you will definitely want help from a professional.\nIt is also advisable to call a professional exterminator if you are allergic to wasp stings, as getting rid of the nest by yourself could be dangerous. In fact, even if you aren't allergic, approaching a wasp's nest can be incredibly dangerous and, in fact, deadly if things go wrong.\nConsider leaving the nest alone. If the wasps' nest is far enough away from your house that it doesn't pose a significant threat, you should consider leaving it alone, especially if it belongs to a less aggressive wasp species such as the paper wasp. Wasps are an important part of the ecosystem, as they pollinate plants and flowers and eat other garden pests such as caterpillars.\nWear protective clothing. It's very important to wear protective clothing when you attempt to get rid of a wasp's nest, to prevent getting stung. Even if you're not allergic, a wasp sting can be painful!\nWear long jeans, socks and boots, a sweater with the hood pulled over your head and gloves.\nYou should also wrap a scarf around the lower half of your face and wear protective glasses or ski goggles.\nIf you are using a pesticide spray, make sure the clothes are old, as residue from the spray could enter the fabric. You should wash or discard the clothes immediately afterwards.\nIf you do happen to get stung while getting rid of the nest, see treatment instructions here.\nNever stand on a ladder to reach a high wasps' nest. If the wasps' nest is somewhere up high, like the eave of a two-story house or a high tree branch, do not use a ladder to attempt to reach it.\nIf you are standing on a ladder and a swarm of wasps flies at you when you disturb the nest, you are very likely to fall and seriously injure yourself.\nIn this situation it is best to call a professional exterminator or use something like the smoke method (see below) to get rid of the wasps.\nYou should only attempt to get rid of a wasps' nest by yourself when it is within easy reach."}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about the supersonic jet?\n\nA Chinese company is developing a supersonic jet capable of traveling from New York to China in just one hour (via Robb Report). The company behind the jet is Space Transportation. It says that it is developing a \u201crocket with wings\u201d, which will work for space tourism and point-to-point travel.\n\nSpace Transportation says that its jet will be lower cost than the rockets that are used to carry satellites into space. It will also be much faster than traditional planes.\n\nTo showcase the speed it hopes to achieve, Space Transportation has included a video on its website. In the video, several passengers climb aboard the supersonic jet. The jet then turns vertically towards the sky and launches into the air. After several seconds of flight, the launch boosters fall away, returning safely to the launch pad where they can be used again later.\n\nThe jet then continues its trek through the clouds and its suborbital journey, eventually traveling 7,000KM to its destination in the span of 60 minutes. The craft shown in the video is impressive, and the speed at which it travels is even more impressive.\n\nSpace Transport plans to run ground tests by 2023. It hopes to commence a first flight of the supersonic jet in 2024, and a crewed flight later in 2025. These plans are ambitious, but the company isn\u2019t stopping there. It also says that it hopes to run a test flight of a crewed space vehicle by 2030."}

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1] was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The Court's decision partially overruled its 1896 decision Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that the \"separate but equal\" notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities.[note 1] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement,[3] and a model for many future impact litigation cases.[4]\n\nThe case originated in 1951 when the public school system in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll local black resident Oliver Brown's daughter at the elementary school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black school farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging that its segregation policy was unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict against the Browns, relying on the precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson, in which the Court had ruled that racial segregation was not in itself a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause if the facilities in question were otherwise equal, a doctrine that had come to be known as \"separate but equal\". The Browns, then represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall, appealed the ruling directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9\u20130 decision in favor of the Browns. The Court ruled that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\", and therefore laws that impose them violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II (349 U.S. 294 (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\".\n\nIn the Southern United States, especially the \"Deep South\", where racial segregation was deeply entrenched, the reaction to Brown among most white people was \"noisy and stubborn\".[5] Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as \"Massive Resistance\", created by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems. Four years later, in the case of Cooper v. Aaron, the Court reaffirmed its ruling in Brown, and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling."}

'This trend toward commodification of high-brow art took an ominous, if predictable, turn in the 1980s during the Japanese \u201cbubble economy.\u201d At a time when Japanese share prices more than doubled, individual tycoons and industrial giants alike invested record amounts in some of the West\u2019s greatest masterpieces. Ryoei Saito, for example, purchased van Gogh\u2019s Portrait of Dr. Gachet for a record-breaking $82.5 million. The work, then on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, suddenly vanished from the public domain. Later learning that he owed the Japanese government $24 million in taxes, Saito remarked that he would have the paining cremated with him to spare his heirs the inheritance tax. This statement, which he later dismissed as a joke, alarmed and enraged many. A representative of the Van Gogh museum, conceding that he had no legal redress, made an ethical appeal to Mr. Saito, asserting, \u201ca work of art remains the possession of the world at large.\u201d\n\nEthical appeals notwithstanding, great art will increasingly devolve into big business. Firstly, great art can only be certified by its market value. Moreover, the \u201cworld at large\u201d hasn\u2019t the means of acquisition. Only one museum currently has the funding to contend for the best pieces\u2013the J. Paul Getty Museum, founded by the billionaire oilman. The art may disappear into private hands, but its transfer will disseminate once static fortunes into the hands of various investors, collectors, and occasionally the artist.'"}

It was sold for 25 cents a copy, with a discount for bulk orders of 100 copies or more.[1]\n\nThe Johns Committee had for several years conducted a witch hunt for homosexuals in public schools, universities, and state government agencies, believing they were part of a Communist strategy to \"subvert the American way of life by controlling academic institutions and by corrupting the nation's moral fiber.\" By publishing its findings, the Committee hoped to persuade the Legislature to enact comprehensive anti-homosexual legislation, and to \"shock Floridians into accepting its program.\"[1]"}

{"prompt": "In 2013, Rocky star Sylvester Stallone described Bruce Willis as \u201cgreedy and lazy,\u201d adding that this was a \u201csure formula for career failure.\u201d Stallone had offered Willis $3 million for three days\u2019 work on The Expendables 3, and Willis had asked for $1 million more. Almost a decade later, Stallone\u2019s observation seems the only possible explanation for Willis\u2019s fall. Once the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, the Die Hard star now has his own category in the annual Golden Raspberry Awards, a parody award show \u2013 also known as the Razzies \u2013 that honors cinematic under-achievements. The category is \u201cWorst Bruce Willis Performance in a 2021 movie.\u201d There are eight candidates. All of the films went straight to video. How did it come to this?Perhaps it all started at some point in the 2000s. Willis was already showing signs of tiring of fighting against his destiny, of having the critics against him and the public on his side only when playing underdogs in action movies. The only thing left was to exactly that; the kind of cinema that was expected of him. He started to accept parts in generic action thrillers, acting with an earpiece so that he wouldn\u2019t have to learn his lines.\n\nWillis\u2019s last attempt to claw back some prestige was in 2015. Having started out in off-Broadway productions, after 30 years without cracking the boards, he returned to theater in an adaptation of Misery. The critics shot down his performance with adjectives such as \u201cinert\u201d and \u201cempty.\u201d Since then, Willis has been staunchly a straight-to-DVD actor. In an industry dominated by franchises, Willis decided he could become one, with Randall Emmett as the wholesale manufacturer of the product.  Can you summarize this into 2 bullet points for me?"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain to me what this article is saying?\n\nPC games can now use DirectStorage, a DirectX 12 Ultimate API that Microsoft announced in 2020. The feature is supposed to bring faster loading times and improved textures and draw distances.\n\nThe Xbox Series X/S already uses DirectStorage, and in June, Microsoft said it would bring the feature to Windows 11. The storage acceleration API should improve gameplay by bringing instant asset introduction and enabling more vivid virtual landscapes. It works by sending data directly from an NVMe SSD to the graphics card, skipping the CPU and leveraging PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 speeds, depending on the system.\n\nIn a developer blog post today, Microsoft said it is moving DirectStorage out of developer preview and making it available via a public SDK.\n\nMicrosoft initially said that Windows 10 wouldn't support DirectStorage but later backtracked. In today's post, Microsoft tried to steer PC gamers toward Windows 11, saying that the operating system \"has the latest storage optimizations built in\" and is the company's \"recommended path for gaming.\"\n\nNo games support DirectStorage on PC yet, but AMD and game developer Luminous Productions recently demoed Forspoken using the feature. The game is expected to release on October 11. Microsoft's blog said the company would have more to say about PC games supporting DirectStorage \"in the future.\"\n\nWe can expect to see more games implement the feature. Sony has already promoted what a speedy NVMe SSD can do for gaming through the fast-loading universe-hopping in the PlayStation 5's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. However, not all PC gamers have moved from SATA to NVMe PCIe 3.0 or later SSDs. Microsoft previously said NVMe was necessary because such SSDs \"can have multiple queues, and each queue can contain many requests at a time, making [them] a good fit for today's gaming workloads that tend to be parallel and batched.\"\n\nDirectStorage also requires an Nvidia RTX 2000 or AMD RX 6000 series graphics card or later."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia entry:\nGeology\nSequoia National Park contains a significant portion of the Sierra Nevada. The park's mountainous landscape includes the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, which rises to 14,505 feet (4,421 m) above sea level.[23] The Great Western Divide parallels the Sierran crest and is visible at various places in the park, for example, Mineral King, Moro Rock, and the Giant Forest. Peaks in the Great Western Divide rise to more than 12,000 feet (3,700 m). Deep canyons lie between the mountains, including Tokopah Valley above Lodgepole, Deep Canyon on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Kern Canyon in the park's backcountry, which is more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) deep for 30 miles (48 km).[24]\n\n\nGreat Western Divide from the summit of Mount Kaweah\nMost of the mountains and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are composed of granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed when molten rock cooled far beneath the surface of the earth. The molten rock was the result of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under the waters of the Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subducting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it proceeded. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have a speckled salt-and-pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas. Valhalla, or the Angel Wings, are prominent granitic cliffs that rise above the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River.[24]\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range, probably not more than 10 million years old. Forces in the earth, probably associated with the development of the Great Basin, forced the mountains to rise. During the last 10 million years, at least four ice ages have coated the mountains in a thick mantle of ice. Glaciers form and develop during long periods of cool and wet weather. Glaciers move very slowly through the mountains, carving deep valleys and craggy peaks. The extensive history of glaciation within the range and the erosion resistant nature of the granitic rocks that make up most of the Sierra Nevada have together created a landscape of hanging valleys, waterfalls, craggy peaks, alpine lakes and glacial canyons.[24]\n\n\nCalcite formations in Crystal Cave\nPark caves, like most caves in the Sierra Nevada of California, are mostly solutional caves dissolved from marble. Marble rock is essentially limestone that was metamorphosed by the heat and pressure of the formation and uplift of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The batholith's rapid uplift over the past 10 million years led to a rapid erosion of the metamorphic rocks in the higher elevations, exposing the granite beneath; therefore, most Sierra Nevada caves are found in the middle and lower elevations (below 7,000 ft or 2,100 m), though some caves are found in the park at elevations as high as 10,000 ft (3,000 m) such as the White Chief cave and Cirque Cave in Mineral King. These caves are carved out of the rock by the abundant seasonal streams in the park. Most of the larger park caves have, or have had, sinking streams running through them.\n\nThe park contains more than 270 known caves, including Lilburn Cave which is California's longest cave with nearly 17 miles (27 km) of surveyed passages.[24] The only commercial cave open to park visitors is Crystal Cave, the park's second-longest cave at over 3.4 miles (5.5 km). Crystal Cave was discovered on April 28, 1918, by Alex Medley and Cassius Webster.[25] The cave is a constant 48 \u00b0F (9 \u00b0C), and is only accessible by guided tour.\n\nCaves are discovered every year in the park with the most recently discovered major cave being Ursa Minor in August 2006.[26][27]"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary about removing a wasp's nest based on this article?\n\nEnsure that you are not allergic to wasp stings. If you're not sure whether you have an allergy to wasp stings or not, it's a good idea to set up an allergy test with your doctor before you attempt to tackle the nest.\nIf the test confirms that you are not allergic to stings, then you can proceed with getting rid of the nest by yourself.\nHowever, if you find out that you do have an allergy, you absolutely should ask someone else to deal with the nest or call an exterminator, as getting stung could be a life-threatening situation.\nContact your local vector control district. Though not available everywhere, vector control deals with disease-carrying or potentially dangerous insects and animals (vectors). These professionals can help you with identification, advise you on what to do, and may even remove the wasps for you.\nDo a quick internet search for \"vector control\" in your area to find contact information and request service.\nCall an exterminator. In most situations, it's best to leave nest removal to the professionals. If there is no vector control district or they are unable to come remove the nest, try an exterminator instead. This is especially true if you have ground-nesting yellow jackets.\nIf the wasp nest is in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, such as inside a wall or attic or underneath a concrete slab, you will definitely want help from a professional.\nIt is also advisable to call a professional exterminator if you are allergic to wasp stings, as getting rid of the nest by yourself could be dangerous. In fact, even if you aren't allergic, approaching a wasp's nest can be incredibly dangerous and, in fact, deadly if things go wrong.\nConsider leaving the nest alone. If the wasps' nest is far enough away from your house that it doesn't pose a significant threat, you should consider leaving it alone, especially if it belongs to a less aggressive wasp species such as the paper wasp. Wasps are an important part of the ecosystem, as they pollinate plants and flowers and eat other garden pests such as caterpillars.\nWear protective clothing. It's very important to wear protective clothing when you attempt to get rid of a wasp's nest, to prevent getting stung. Even if you're not allergic, a wasp sting can be painful!\nWear long jeans, socks and boots, a sweater with the hood pulled over your head and gloves.\nYou should also wrap a scarf around the lower half of your face and wear protective glasses or ski goggles.\nIf you are using a pesticide spray, make sure the clothes are old, as residue from the spray could enter the fabric. You should wash or discard the clothes immediately afterwards.\nIf you do happen to get stung while getting rid of the nest, see treatment instructions here.\nNever stand on a ladder to reach a high wasps' nest. If the wasps' nest is somewhere up high, like the eave of a two-story house or a high tree branch, do not use a ladder to attempt to reach it.\nIf you are standing on a ladder and a swarm of wasps flies at you when you disturb the nest, you are very likely to fall and seriously injure yourself.\nIn this situation it is best to call a professional exterminator or use something like the smoke method (see below) to get rid of the wasps.\nYou should only attempt to get rid of a wasps' nest by yourself when it is within easy reach."}

{"prompt": "What are the most important facts in this article? \"Napoleon Dynamite (Heder) is a socially awkward 16-year-old from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his grandmother, Carlinda Dynamite, and his older brother, Kipland Ronald \"Kip\" Dynamite. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, reluctantly dealing with various bullies who torment him.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother is injured in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to travel from Detroit to see him while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon.\n\nPedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The factions of the two candidates put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a Future Farmers of America competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a thrift store and buys an instructional dance VHS called D-Qwon's Dance Grooves, becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives from Detroit and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"Larger than Life\" by the Backstreet Boys with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai. Napoleon's routine receives a standing ovation from students, stunning Summer, and her boyfriend, Don.\n\nPedro becomes the class president, Kip, and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, Rico reunites with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returns from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play tetherball.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nWhy the craic's coming back to Ireland\n\nAfter some of the longest Covid-19 restrictions in Europe, Ireland is looking to 2022 and beyond with optimism.\n\nAAfter 20 months of Covid-19 restrictions, one of the longest stretches in Europe, Ireland recently lifted its 20:00 curfew on restaurants, bars, and indoor events and removed limits on the number of people gathered. As a result, residents are heralding the return of the craic, the atmosphere of fun and conversation that permeates the Irish social scene.\n\n\"Spring is in the air, figuratively and literally,\" said Dublin resident Ray Commins, founder of walking tour company Generation Tours. \"There's a real sense of optimism as we emerge from a winter (two in fact) of discontent. I don't think there's been a spring or summer we've looked forward to more in my time.\"\n\nNowhere is that more evident than in the classic Irish pubs, where socialising and singing have finally returned \u2013 a culture no longer taken for granted by the locals.\n\n\"We missed it dearly as a society here, and having it back is an incredible boost to morale,\" said Commins.\n\nWhy should I go now?\n\nDublin, Ireland's capital, is rapidly preparing for its first \"proper\" St Patrick's Festival since 2019, a four-day celebration from 16 to 20 March, featuring music, the iconic parade, theatre and a food and craft village. Though the capital hosts the largest celebration, many Irish cities, including Cork, Galway and Kilkenny, each host their own parade in honour of the country's patron saint.\n\nThe hospitality industry in Ireland expects international travellers to return in droves this summer, so spring and autumn may be the best time to beat the global crowds. Among locals, the vaccination programme has been one of the most successful across Europe, with more than 95% of adults vaccinated and 72% receiving a booster, according to the ECDC.\n\nTravel with no trace\n\nThe country has seen a number of new hotel openings and re-openings, all of which have taken sustainability seriously. In County Tipperary, 200km south-west of Dublin, the five-star Cashel Palace Hotel is set to open in March 2022. The hotel composts all its food waste to later be used in its on-site gardens, and sources as much food as possible from producers all within the county's borders, many of which are part of the national food sustainability program Origin Green.\n\nThe Wren Urban Nest in Dublin opened in September and aims to be one of Ireland's most sustainable hotels, eschewing the use of any fossil fuels. \"They use 100% renewable energy, avoid single-use plastics and source locally as much as possible,\" said Kate McCabe, co-founder of eco travel company Bog & Thunder. \"It's really easy to see their commitment.\"\n\nEven historical sites like 18th-Century Ballynahinch Castle in Co Galway has embraced its connection and responsibility to the land. The estate has worked to remove invasive plant species and developed a biodiversity plan for the grounds that helps protect the salmon that run within the neighbouring Owenmore River.\n\nMcCabe has also been excited to see a renewed commitment to local eating here. \"Ireland has really embraced the farm-to-table ethos,\" she said. \"It's quite common for restaurants to list their sources on their menus \u2013 a locavore's paradise!\"\n\nIreland has really embraced the farm-to-table ethos\nSome of her favourite spots include Kildair-based Aimsir, which serves only food grown, harvested, fished or foraged within the Emerald Isle's borders; and the Wicklow Escape, a small inn 50km south of Dublin that pairs its garden lodgings with local specialties like wild boar and venison pie and Atlantic cod and scallops.\n\nTo further connect visitors with the land, McCabe often takes visitors to Cnoc Suain, a hillside settlement on the west coast within a Special Area of Conservation in the Connemara region. The founders offer events and education in the cultural heritage of the region as well as its unique bogland ecology.\n\nKnow before you go\n\nIreland requires either proof of vaccination or proof of recovery from a Covid-19 infection within the past six months. As of 1 February, travellers must also have a booster dose if it has been more than 270 days since the final dose in the initial vaccine series.\n\nPassengers without proof must submit a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. For EU residents, Ireland participates in the EU Digital Covid Certificate Program, which provides digital documentation on vaccination status and makes it easier to travel between EU member countries. Travellers must also fill out a Passenger Locator Form before arrival.\n\nFace covering requirements were fully lifted across Ireland in February, with the exception of health-care environments. Many local public health experts within the country still recommend the wearing of masks, but their use is voluntary.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nLisbon: The public transit design utopia\n\nLisbon is a public transit aficionado\u2019s dream. Whether it is the unique Elevador de Santa Justa or the city\u2019s iconic yellow trams, picturesquely winding their way up the steep narrow streets. In this City Snapshot, Dr Chris Hale heads west and argues that Lisbon\u2019s metro should be what puts this ancient city at the forefront of public transit design.\n\nAll cities like to claim to be unique, but there is nowhere else on the planet like Lisbon. Once the seat of a mighty empire, Lisbon retains a sense of grandeur in particular locations and precincts. But the city has clearly mellowed over the past couple of centuries. And is these days more a collection of quirky neighbourhoods.\n\nLisbon offers a much better sense of personal intimacy than other former empire seats such as Berlin, Paris, London, or even Brussels \u2013 all of which feature a threshold number of inhuman vistas and over-scale architectural moments. You can try hard to enjoy Berlin, but you\u2019ll definitely enjoy yourself in Lisbon \u2013 whatever your starting mood, and without trying.\n\nWith a great many steep hills, as well as extensive water frontages, in Lisbon you\u2019re only ever a couple of hundred metres away from a magnificent vista. And once you\u2019ve reached a particular corner of the city, the effort of getting there lends itself to lingering around that place for deeper exploration.\n\nLisbon\u2019s small trams blur the lines between real public transport and a toy train set. Probably with the carrying capacity of the latter, and a similar sense of fun.\n\nBut Lisbon\u2019s more important contribution to world transport concepts comes from its relatively new metro system. It was inaugurated in 1959, initially as a Y-shaped network but has progressively grown since to encompass 56 stations on 4 separate lines to date.\n\nThe latest extension is currently under construction, to close the loop of the Green Line between Rato and Cais do Sodr\u00e9, with two new stations: Estrela and Santos.\n\nThis expansion will also link to other public transport modes, namely Comboios de Portugal\u2019s Lisboa-Cascais line on the national railway network and river ports linking Lisbo, to its south shore neighbouring suburbs across the Tagus River.\n\nCarrying on the theme of \u2018unique neighbourhoods\u2019 \u2013 each station is startlingly unique and startlingly colourful. Station designers have taken relatively straightforward underground box stations, and used colour, lighting, detail, and art to striking effect \u2013 such as Olaias station at the top of this article. Drawing on Lisbon\u2019s penchant for tiled walls, most of the stations get their flavour and colour from a complex and coherent mosaic of multi-coloured tiles.\n\nWhile there have been slow efforts in some international metro and rail systems to brighten up stations and give them more character, Lisbon has definitely set the benchmark.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been lucky to travel and experience a great many rail systems in world cities \u2013 Lisbon\u2019s metro is the most fun, and the least sterile. And in this regard, Lisbon should be the world\u2019s main provenance of rail and metro design cues over the coming decade."}

{"prompt": "Please can you summarize the article below into three concise sentences?\n\nThe Marvellous Neil Baldwin is back to make us feel better\n\nNeil Baldwin was taken to the nation's hearts thanks to the Bafta-winning BBC film Marvellous, in which he was played by Toby Jones. He has now helped create a theatre version.\n\nPeople who get their life stories turned into films and plays are usually celebrities or politicians or those who have done something particularly heroic or remarkable. On the face of it, Neil Baldwin is an unlikely subject.\n\nHe's a former clown and Stoke City kit man who wasn't well-known - at least beyond his Staffordshire home town - and hasn't been at the centre of any daring or dramatic historical events.\n\nBut viewers who watched the heartwarming Marvellous in 2014 came to realise he is remarkable and heroic in his own way.\n\nThey saw his uncanny ability to spread positivity and endear himself to everybody he meets, from students to archbishops to footballers.\n\nThey also saw how he always manages to get what he wants and keep going in the face of adversity, his learning difficulties anything but an obstacle.\n\n\"When I saw it, I thought, that's a good film,\" he says now. \"The best film ever made. And I still think it is.\"\n\nMarvellous won three Baftas in 2015 including best single drama, and was also showered with prizes from the Royal Television Society, Broadcasting Press Guild and Monte Carlo TV Festival.\n\nSince then, Baldwin has received other honours including the freedom of Stoke-on-Trent and the British Empire Medal for services to the community in Newcastle-under-Lyme.\n\nHe now wears that medal everywhere, and has it pinned to the lapel of his jacket when he comes to Newcastle-under-Lyme's New Vic theatre to discuss the stage adaptation.\n\nHe has created the show with the venue's artistic director Theresa Heskins, and it is finally reaching the stage after lengthy pandemic-enforced delays.\n\n\"Three times it was postponed because of the pandemic,\" says Heskins, who has joined Baldwin in the theatre's lounge during a break from rehearsals.\n\nShe says to him: \"Every time I phoned you, I thought, how am I going to tell Neil?\n\n\"He made me feel better every single time. I'd phone him up feeling dreadful about it, and then I'd put the phone down feeling so much better - which is Neil's special power.\"\n\nThe play will have its official opening night on Baldwin's 76th birthday, on Tuesday.\n\nFormer Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams recently conducted a special service in Baldwin's honour to mark his 62 years on campus at Keele University, where his mother worked as a cleaner and where the young Baldwin made himself a popular presence and unofficial mascot.\n\nA far back as 1968, he was granted honorary life membership of the students' union, and he received an honorary degree in 2013.\n\nHis love of making people laugh led him to join the circus as Nello the clown in 1980. His other passions include Stoke City FC, and when he introduced himself to new manager Lou Macari in 1991, Macari decided Baldwin would be a force for good in the dressing room.\n\nHe made Baldwin the kit man and described him as \"my best-ever signing\".\n\n\"His real value was in helping the players relax before games,\" Macari wrote in his autobiography. \"No chemist ever produced a drug that could reduce stress levels like Nello. I was convinced that this gave us an edge in matches. Nello bonded the group.\"\n\nBaldwin has even run his own football club, named Neil Baldwin FC, at Keele University since 1967, asking the likes of Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker to serve stints as its president. They agreed, of course.\n\nBaldwin published his autobiography in 2015 and when they started work on the play, he and Heskins went through his life story with a set of actors.\n\n\"We'd say to Neil, 'There's this bit in the autobiography, could you tell us a little bit more about that?\" Heskins explains.\n\n\"He'd tell us, then we'd try to re-stage that. While the actors were improvising, Neil would say, 'I think I did that and I said that.' And then we'd do those things.\"\n\nShe adds, addressing Baldwin: \"Always, whenever we wanted to get a bit serious, you'd be the person that would always be telling us, 'Wouldn't it be funny if she had itching powder in her skirt now?'\"\n\nThe world could do with more of Neil Baldwin's spirit-lifting powers. So what is his secret of staying upbeat?\n\n\"I just stay positive,\" he replies simply, before recalling a conversation with a young friend whose mother had recently died.\n\n\"He rung me up on Christmas Day and said, 'Why do you keep on being happy?' I said, 'Life is very short sometimes and you've got to keep happy.'\"\n\nHeskins has tried to dig deeper. \"Remember that time I trapped you in the auditorium for two hours?\" she says to him. \"I wouldn't let you out until you answered exactly that question. What is your recipe for happiness?\n\n\"You kept saying to me, 'Just be happy.' And I kept saying, 'What if some people can't? Offer me some concrete ideas.'\n\n\"You said, 'Get a pet. Sing. Have friends.' You said to me, 'I know I live on my own, but I've got that many friends.' And you said, 'That's one of the keys to being happy, having people.'\n\n\"You have all those friends and you are lovely to them. You make people feel good about themselves by being so kind to them, and that makes people happy. That feels like your amazing recipe for happiness. And also laughing.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Baldwin says. \"I always do try to keep laughing. Sometimes people do get upset. But you've always got life to live.\"\n\nRoyal approval\nBaldwin's trademark positivity was justified when it came to making Marvellous. \"Before the film ever came out, I said, 'We're going to London to the Baftas.' [Writer] Peter Bowker says, 'Don't be a fool.' I said, 'You'll be the fool if we win.' And we won.\"\n\nThat film opened doors for Baldwin to make even more friends in high places. A devout royalist, he recounts a visit to Buckingham Palace, one of his proudest days.\n\n\"William and Kate were there and William said to me, 'You've won a Bafta haven't you? What a film that was.'\n\n\"And I said to Kate, 'What lovely children you've got.' She said, 'Thank you, sir.' I turned around and said, 'I'm not a sir till you make me one!'\"\n\nMarvellous made Baldwin something approaching a national treasure, and there's still room for more gongs on his lapel."}

The incursions, dozens upon dozens, continued into the night and the days that followed and surged to the highest numbers ever on Monday, when 56 warplanes tested Taiwan\u2019s beleaguered air defenses.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s jets scrambled to keep up, while the United States warned China that its \u201cprovocative military activity\u201d undermined \u201cregional peace and stability.\u201d China did not cower. When a Taiwanese combat air traffic controller radioed one Chinese aircraft, the pilot dismissed the challenge with an obscenity involving the officer\u2019s mother.\n\nAs such confrontations intensify, the balance of power around Taiwan is fundamentally shifting, pushing a decades-long impasse over its future into a dangerous new phase.\n\nAfter holding out against unification demands from China\u2019s communist rulers for more than 70 years, Taiwan is now at the heart of the deepening discord between China and the United States. The island\u2019s fate has the potential to reshape the regional order and even to ignite a military conflagration \u2014 intentional or not."}

I don't understand some of the terminology. \"The latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and \u201cparalyze\u201d the assets of Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cThe ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,\u201d wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\nPutin\u2019s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his \u201cfortress\u201d economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n\u201cWe will ... ban the transactions of Russia\u2019s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin\u2019s war,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its \u201crainy day fund,\u201d senior US administration officials said.\n\n\u201cOur strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia\u2019s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n\u201cExternal conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,\u201d the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. \u201cThis is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,\u201d the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports \u2014 including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia\u2019s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cSo there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.\u201d\n\nA run on the banks\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions target Russia\u2019s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia\u2019s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,\u201d the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,\u201d it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. \n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of \u201csignificant deposit outflows\u201d triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\u201cThis led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,\u201d the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%. Other Russian companies with foreign listings were also hammered. Gas giant Gazprom (GZPFY) dropped 37% in London trading. Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles \u2014 a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets. The government had also ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents outside of Russia from March 1, Reuters reported.'"}

People who preordered Starlink and paid deposits but haven't yet received it will have to pay $549 for the user terminal if they choose to keep their orders.\n\n\"Due to excessive levels of inflation, the price of the Starlink kit is increasing from $499 to $549 for deposit holders and $599 for all new orders, effective today. In addition, the Starlink monthly service price will increase from $99 to $110,\" Starlink said in an email to customers yesterday.\n\n\"Can't even honor the preorder pricing on the equipment? Brutal,\" Jon Guidry of Georgia wrote on Twitter. Guidry forwarded us the email he got from Starlink, which says, \"The sole purpose of these adjustments is to keep pace with rising inflation.\" People who preorder have to put down a deposit of $99. Those who already did that can cancel the deposit for a full refund on their account page, the email from Starlink notes.\n\nPosts in a Reddit thread indicate that the monthly increase to $110 also applies to Starlink customers who already have service.\n\n\"Since launching our public beta service in October 2020, the Starlink team has tripled the number of satellites in orbit, quadrupled the number of ground stations, and made continuous improvements to our network,\" the email from Starlink says. \"Going forward, users can expect Starlink to maintain its cadence of continuous network improvements as well as new feature additions.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this information on a charities project: Agriculture\nMarket-oriented agricultural development\nA number of Mercy Corps' agriculture-related programs are jointly delivered with objectives in other areas such as water conservation, disaster resilience, emergency crisis response and market system development. For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]"}

{"prompt": "From this text, when was Prince Charles born? - Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (20 December 1720 \u2013 30 January 1788) was the elder son of James Francis Edward Stuart, grandson of James II and VII, and the Stuart claimant to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland after 1766 as Charles III. During his lifetime, he was also known as \"the Young Pretender\" and \"the Young Chevalier\"; in popular memory, he is known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. He is best remembered for his role in the 1745 rising; his defeat at Culloden in April 1746 effectively ended the Stuart cause, and subsequent attempts failed to materialise, such as a planned French invasion in 1759.[2] His escape from Scotland after the uprising led to his portrayal as a romantic figure of heroic failure."}

He was the author of the Marganitha (The book of the jewel), one of the most important ecclesiastical texts of the Assyrian Church of the East, a kind of theological encyclopedy.\n\nHe wrote in Syriac biblical commentaries, polemical treatises against heresy as well as dogmatic and legal writings.[3] He also wrote texts in metrical form including an author catalog, which has for the Syrian literary history an important role.[4]"}

Taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony is an emotional moment for many immigrants, and for good reason: it is the culmination of an often arduous process and many years of striving. Citizenship also opens a new chapter marked by possibility, from better job prospects to full participation in civic life.\n\nYet for many immigrants who aspire to become U.S. citizens, that moment never arrives. Since the 1970s, naturalization rates in the United States have lagged behind those of other major host countries. It\u2019s a striking disparity given that the vast majority of immigrants in the United States express interest in citizenship. And since gaining citizenship often boosts immigrants\u2019 social mobility and integration, the fact that so many are left behind points to a troubling loss of solidarity for their host communities.\n\nWhat holds them back? Why are some immigrants more likely than others to complete the naturalization process?\n\nIPL research provides the first concrete evidence of a major barrier to citizenship for low-income immigrants. The findings help explain why citizenship-promotion efforts face significant challenges, and they provide a blueprint for solutions to ensure that all immigrants have equal access to citizenship and its benefits.\n\nA Life-Changing Program\nIn seeking to understand disparities in naturalization patterns, previous studies have focused on the immigrants themselves\u2014individual characteristics like language skills, resources, or country of origin. Here, the researchers considered an external factor out of immigrants\u2019 control: the high costs of the citizenship application process.\n\nFor many low-income immigrants, the price tag is daunting: $725 just to file the application, plus hundreds or even thousands more if you need English classes or consultations with immigration lawyers. Charitable organizations have stepped up to provide free language training, legal advice, and help navigating the paperwork. But the application fee has only become more burdensome, rising by 800 percent in real terms since 1985, when it was $35 (or $80.25 in today\u2019s dollars). The federal government offers a fee waiver for the poorest immigrants\u2014those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line\u2014but for many others who aren\u2019t destitute but struggle to make ends meet, that fee alone can put citizenship out of reach.\n\nTo address this potentially pivotal financial obstacle, IPL teamed up with the New York State Office for New Americans (ONA) and two funders dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable New Yorkers, Robin Hood and New York Community Trust. Together we developed an innovative, public-private program called NaturalizeNY, which offers low-income immigrants an opportunity to win a voucher covering the naturalization application fee.\n\nVeyom Bahl, a managing director at Robin Hood, said, \u201cRobin Hood is proud to partner with the world-class researchers at the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab. Like us, they are committed to helping immigrant families build a strong footing for a new life in the United States. This research will help foundations, community-based organizations, and policymakers alike re-think how we invest in our communities for maximum impact.\u201d\n\nNaturalizeNY also connects registrants with application assistance from ONA\u2019s network of nonprofit service providers. New York\u2019s leading immigrant service organizations, including CUNY Citizenship Now!, Hispanic Federation, and Catholic Charities, were also integral in promoting and implementing the program.\n\n\u201cThis was a truly first-of-a-kind program, where a state agency, philanthropies, academics, and nonprofits created a way to provide direct financial support to help low-income immigrants apply for citizenship. The Immigration Policy Lab was excited to partner in its design and evaluation so everyone involved could understand its impact on immigrants and the New York community,\u201d said Michael Hotard, an IPL program manager."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a few important details from this article?\n\nThe count of confirmed exoplanets just ticked past the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA space telescopes.\n\nNot so long ago, we lived in a universe with only a small number of known planets, all of them orbiting our Sun. But a new raft of discoveries marks a scientific high point: More than 5,000 planets are now confirmed to exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe planetary odometer turned on March 21, with the latest batch of 65 exoplanets \u2013 planets outside our immediate solar family \u2013 added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The archive records exoplanet discoveries that appear in peer-reviewed, scientific papers, and that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods or by analytical techniques.\n\nThe 5,000-plus planets found so far include small, rocky worlds like Earth, gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, and \u201chot Jupiters\u201d in scorchingly close orbits around their stars. There are \u201csuper-Earths,\u201d which are possible rocky worlds bigger than our own, and \u201cmini-Neptunes,\u201d smaller versions of our system\u2019s Neptune. Add to the mix planets orbiting two stars at once and planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a number,\u201d said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. \u201cEach one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u201d\n\nWe do know this: Our galaxy likely holds hundreds of billions of such planets. The steady drumbeat of discovery began in 1992 with strange new worlds orbiting an even stranger star. It was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar, a rapidly spinning stellar corpse that pulses with millisecond bursts of searing radiation. Measuring slight changes in the timing of the pulses allowed scientists to reveal planets in orbit around the pulsar.\n\nFinding just three planets around this spinning star essentially opened the floodgates, said Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system.\n\n\u201cIf you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\u201d Wolszczan said. \u201cThe planet production process has to be very robust.\u201d\n\nWolszczan, who still searches for exoplanets as a professor at Penn State, says we\u2019re opening an era of discovery that will go beyond simply adding new planets to the list. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, continues to make new exoplanet discoveries. But soon powerful next-generation telescopes and their highly sensitive instruments, starting with the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, will capture light from the atmospheres of exoplanets, reading which gases are present to potentially identify tell-tale signs of habitable conditions.\n\nThe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, expected to launch in 2027, will make new exoplanet discoveries using a variety of methods. The ESA (European Space Agency) mission ARIEL, launching in 2029, will observe exoplanet atmospheres; a piece of NASA technology aboard, called CASE, will help zero in on exoplanet clouds and hazes.\n\n\u201cTo my thinking, it is inevitable that we\u2019ll find some kind of life somewhere \u2013 most likely of some primitive kind,\u201d Wolszczan said. The close connection between the chemistry of life on Earth and chemistry found throughout the universe, as well as the detection of widespread organic molecules, suggests detection of life itself is only a matter of time, he added."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the harmful chemical found in products? Please summarize the article in 3 or 4 sentences for me. \n\nIndependent testing has found hundreds of popular personal care items in the US to be contaminated with benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, prompting several big brands to voluntarily recall dozens of products in recent months.\n\nThe lab, Valisure, last year detected benzene in hand sanitizers, sunscreens, deodorant, dry shampoos, conditioners, antiperspirants, deodorants, body sprays and anti-fungal treatments. The contamination has been most frequently detected in aerosol or spray products, some at levels the Food and Drug Administration characterized as \u201clife-threatening\u201d.\n\nThe findings suggest that benzene contamination is widespread and is probably in more products that have not yet been tested, said David Light, Valisure\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cBenzene really shouldn\u2019t be there at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a fundamental problem in the manufacturing of a lot of consumer products.\u201d To date, Valisure has tested 662 items and found the chemical in 180, or about 27%, of products.\n\nProcter & Gamble, Bayer, CVS and Johnson & Johnson have issued voluntary recalls for widely distributed brands including Brut, Sure, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Old Spice, Secret, Tinactin, Lotrimin, Coppertone, Neutrogena and Aveeno. Among the recalled hand sanitizer brands are Art Naturals, Best Brands and Natural Wunderz.\n\nLight pointed to \u201cdecades of research\u201d that has found no safe levels of benzene exposure because it\u2019s so toxic at very low levels. The petroleum-based chemical \u201ccauses cancer\u201d, especially leukemia and in blood forming organs, the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote. The toxin has also been shown to harm the central nervous system and reproductive organs.\n\nThe US banned benzene\u2019s use as an ingredient nearly 45 years ago, and it is \u201csomewhat unique in that it\u2019s pretty well established to be incredibly toxic \u2013 that\u2019s been known for decades to over a century,\u201d said David Andrews, senior scientist at the public health advocate Environmental Working Group.\n\nAdvocates took aim at the Food and Drug Administration for failing to do more to protect the public. In a December statement, the agency said it was investigating the situation, doing its own testing and urged companies to recall contaminated products.\n\nThough the agency lacks the authority to order recalls and may be limited in its pre-market authority to require testing, advocates are calling on the FDA to clarify an existing benzene limit, set new exposure limits, and conduct more testing of products on store shelves to ensure they are safe, instead of leaving that up to independent labs. The FDA\u2019s system \u201creally lacks independent review\u201d because it relies on companies to self report, Light said.\n\nFederal rules allow benzene to be used in the manufacture of personal care products, and that can cause it to end up in goods, even if it\u2019s not listed as an ingredient. Benzene can also be added in emergency situations, like the pandemic, or if it provides \u201csignificant therapeutic\u201d advantages. In such scenarios, the FDA\u2019s limit is two parts per million, but some products that provided no therapeutic advantage were found with levels as high as 21 ppm.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA wrote it \u201ccontinues to monitor the issue\u201d and work with companies to recall contaminated products. Though the agency doesn\u2019t have exposure limits, it informs companies that \u201csolvents such as benzene should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, or drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity.\u201d\n\nSome companies have capitalized on the confusing regulations and gaps to downplay the problem. Johnson & Johnson, which recalled sunscreens in July, said \u201cdaily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s statement was posted by the FDA on its website even though agency scientists found in a July analysis obtained by Consumer Reports that benzene-contaminated sunscreen did pose a \u201clife-threatening risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cIs the FDA serving these companies or the public?\u201d Andrews asked.\n\nHow benzene is landing in products remains a bit of a mystery in some instances. Companies claim they aren\u2019t adding it to their formulas, and the FDA theorized that it\u2019s probably in contaminated thickening agents, preservatives, spray propellant or ethanol.\n\nIn many cases, Valisure found one batch of a product would contain benzene while another of the same product would not. That highlights the complexities and lack of oversight in the global supply chains that produce personal care products. A propellant like butane that\u2019s refined very early in the manufacturing process \u201ctouches dozens of different hands\u201d in its journey from raw material to sunscreen on a shelf, yet nobody detected benzene, Light said.\n\nValisure most frequently found benzene in body sprays, which includes deodorants and anti-perspirants: nearly half of the 108 products from 30 different brands contained it. The highest levels were found in Sure, Old Spice, Secret, Equate, Right Guard, Tag and Brut.\n\nValisure tested nearly 300 sunscreens or after-sun products and found detectable levels in 77, or about 27%, of samples. Among those with the highest levels were Neutrogena, CVS, Sun Bum, Raw Elements and Banana Boat. Though spray-on sunscreen was found to be contaminated most frequently, the chemical was also detected in lotions and gels.\n\nValisure\u2019s hand sanitizer analysis found the highest levels of benzene in small brands that popped up as demand for the product spiked. Out of 260 samples from 168 brands sold on Amazon, at pharmacies and at box stores such as Target, 44, or about 17%, had detectable levels of benzene. Products from household names like Purell and Suave didn\u2019t contain the chemical.\n\nIn its December statement, TPC Hot Acquisition, which owns Brut and Sure, wrote: \u201cTo date, no reports of adverse events related to this recall have been reported. This voluntary recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s nearly impossible to legally prove that one specific chemical has caused an illness, and Andrews noted benzene has a latency period of 10 to 15 years. \u201cThe time lag between exposure and cancer can be a long period of time,\u201d he said."}

And officials said the student affairs office plans to tap experts to brainstorm measures beyond clinical support. Over the last two years, Stanford increased its clinical staff by 20%, which officials said reduced wait times for those seeking services.\n\nThe move comes as students increasingly seek therapy and other wellness services on campus \u2014 a trend that saw a sharp spike during the pandemic. And there's evidence suicide attempts are increasing among young people. Meanwhile, colleges and universities are struggling to keep up with demand because of a shortage in mental health clinicians, California Healthline reports.\n\n\"Mental health remains not only an ongoing challenge but our most urgent priority,\" wrote Dee Mostofi, a spokesperson for the university, in an email.\n\nStanford officials said recent losses \"can feel especially overwhelming\" amid the ongoing pandemic and outbreak of war in Ukraine, and urged those struggling emotionally to reach out for help.\n\n\"For all in our community who are suffering, know that whatever feelings are arising in you are normal and need time to be felt,\" officials added. \"There\u2019s no one way or right way to grieve, and we are here to support each other as we find our own paths to healing.\"\n\nCan you summarize this with 2 bullet points?"}

The male, which is much larger than the female, weighs 410 to 720 kg (900 to 1,600 pounds). It grows to about 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) tall at the shoulder and 2.2\u20132.5 metres in length. The tail is 7\u201312 cm (3\u20135 inches) long. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear\u2019s black skin. Under the skin is a layer of insulating fat. The broad feet have hairy soles to protect and insulate as well as to facilitate movement across ice, as does the uneven skin on the soles of the feet, which helps to prevent slipping. Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey.\n\nPolar bears are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds. The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born. Polar bears prefer ice that is subject to periodic fracturing by wind and sea currents, because these fractures offer seals access to both air and water. As their prey is aquatic, polar bears are excellent swimmers, and they are even known to kill beluga whales. In swimming, the polar bear uses only its front limbs, an aquatic adaptation found in no other four-legged mammal. Polar bears are opportunistic as well as predatory: they will consume dead fish and carcasses of stranded whales and eat garbage near human settlements.\n\nMating occurs in spring, and implantation of the fertilized ovum is delayed.

Cubs weigh less than 1 kg at birth and are not weaned until after they are two years old. Young polar bears may die of starvation or may be killed by adult males, and for this reason female polar bears are extremely defensive of their young when adult males are present. Young remain with their mothers until they reach sexual maturity. Females first reproduce at four to eight years of age and breed every two to four years thereafter. Males mature at about the same age as females but do not breed until a few years later. Adult polar bears have no natural predators, though walruses and wolves can kill them. Longevity in the wild is 25 to 30 years, but in captivity several polar bears have lived to more than 35 years old."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below in three concise sentences that you feel best describe the article as a whole:\n\nSaharan sands float north to Europe, coating cities with dust\n\nThe sandstorm, known as a calima in Spain, began covering much of the Iberian Peninsula on Tuesday morning, blanketing cars and buildings in a thick red dust and making it harder to breathe in the stiflingly dry air.\n\nA calima occurs when a burst of dusty, warm wind forms during sandstorms in the Sahara and then crosses over from the African desert. With rain forecast in Madrid on Thursday morning, residents were bracing themselves for a muddy rain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much that can be done at this stage,\u201d said Miguel Serrano, a porter in Madrid, who said he had been busy sweeping dust outside his building Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s now see whether the rain helps clean it up or at least makes the air more pleasant.\u201d\n\nWhile Spain\u2019s skies tended toward the apocalyptic, with blood orange colours reminiscent of areas besieged by wildfires, the effects were more subtle elsewhere.\n\nFrom the Swiss Alps to Britain, residents of countries far from the Sahara looked out their windows Wednesday and noticed something slightly off. It was not the end times, sky-on-fire hues of Spain, but rather a vague sense that this is not how it usually is.\n\nIn London, it was as if the skies had been run through a sepia-toned filter, a slightly unsettling aura that could easily be taken as a harbinger of nothing good. It was the grey-orange colour the sky would be in a movie about a town recovering from nuclear fallout.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon isn\u2019t new, the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service described this week\u2019s events as \u201can exceptional Saharan dust episode,\u201d with \u201cvery high concentrations of coarse particulate matter.\u201d\n\nMark Parrington, a senior scientist at the service, said it was not unusual in February and March for wind to kick up sand in the Sahara, sending it on an international voyage as far away as South America. There were traces of Saharan dust in Britain last year as well, he said.\n\nBut it is typically not as noticeable as it has been this week, he said. The storm was stronger because of \u201cweather patterns being in the right configuration to bring it directly into Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the coming days, the dust is expected to move north through Europe, reaching as far as Denmark, before fading by the weekend, the monitoring service said.\n\n\u201cThe current concentrations of particulate matter in the transports are exceptionally high, and some studies predict that climate change will result in even more intense Saharan dust storms in the future,\u201d the service said in a statement. It added that the storms would threaten to worsen air quality, affect the frequency of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and speed the decline of glaciers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spain\u2019s health ministry called the sandstorm an emergency situation and issued a warning to residents to stay indoors and keep doors and windows shut to avoid inhaling particles, particularly people with existing breathing problems. The ministry also warned drivers to show caution because of diminished visibility. Overall, the ministry said people should \u201creduce all outdoor activity.\u201d\n\nSpain is often on the front line of winds and storms coming from the Sahara and Sahel deserts because it is separated from Morocco only by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar. Still, weather experts said that it was rare for the calima to hit Madrid and other parts of central or northern Spain with such intensity.\n\nEpisodes of calima are, however, relatively common in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the northwestern coast of Africa. In February 2020, the Canary Islands were hit by their worst sandstorm in 40 years, forcing airports to close at a time of year when the islands receive many tourists from northern Europe seeking a mild winter climate."}

The up-front hardware cost was raised from $499 to $599 (a 20 percent increase), and the monthly service price was raised from $99 to $110 (up 11 percent). People who preordered Starlink and paid deposits but haven't yet received it will have to pay $549 for the user terminal if they choose to keep their orders.\n\n\"Due to excessive levels of inflation, the price of the Starlink kit is increasing from $499 to $549 for deposit holders and $599 for all new orders, effective today. In addition, the Starlink monthly service price will increase from $99 to $110,\" Starlink said in an email to customers yesterday.\n\n\"Can't even honor the preorder pricing on the equipment? Brutal,\" Jon Guidry of Georgia wrote on Twitter. Guidry forwarded us the email he got from Starlink, which says, \"The sole purpose of these adjustments is to keep pace with rising inflation.\" People who preorder have to put down a deposit of $99. Those who already did that can cancel the deposit for a full refund on their account page, the email from Starlink notes.\n\nPosts in a Reddit thread indicate that the monthly increase to $110 also applies to Starlink customers who already have service.\n\n\"Since launching our public beta service in October 2020, the Starlink team has tripled the number of satellites in orbit, quadrupled the number of ground stations, and made continuous improvements to our network,\" the email from Starlink says. \"Going forward, users can expect Starlink to maintain its cadence of continuous network improvements as well as new feature additions.\""}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the credit reporting agencies?\n\nThree of the country's largest credit reporting agencies are removing nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports, the companies announced in a joint statement Friday.\n\nEquifax (EFX), Experian (EXPGF) and TransUnion (TRU) will eliminate billions of dollars from the accounts of consumers who faced unexpected medical bills that they were unable to pay. The three firms said they made the move after months of research.\n\"Medical collections debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we're taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal well-being,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\nThe announcement follows research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing that Americans had racked up $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records as of June 2021. It's the most common debt collection credit account on credit records, the CFPB said.\nMedical debt can be volatile and unpredictable, and can negatively affect many financially secure consumers. Black, Hispanic, young and low-income consumers are most likely to be impacted by medical debt, the bureau said.\nMedical debt concerns have heightened since the Covid-19 pandemic hospitalized millions of people, and CFBP Director Rohit Chopra has been publicly critical of medical debt collections by credit reporting agencies. On March 1, Chopra said the CFPD will be \"closely scrutinizing\" the Big Three credit reporting agencies.\n\"We expect them to take seriously their role as major actors in the credit reporting system -- a system whose integrity and accuracy can determine the financial futures of hundreds of millions of people,\" Chopra said.\nStarting July 1, paid medical collection debt will no longer be included on consumer credit reports. Millions of Americans had credit scores previously lowered because debts paid after being sent to collections could appear on credit reports for up to seven years.\nMore changes are expected. It will now take one month before unpaid medical collection debt appears on a consumer's report, instead of six months, the previous standard.\nThe three companies also said that starting in the first half of 2023, medical collection debt less than $500 will no longer be included on credit reports."}

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- standing trial in federal court for violating Floyd's civil rights.\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyds death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyd's death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nAll three are each charged with deprivation of rights under color of law as Chauvin restrained Floyd. Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, resulting in Floyd's death. The three have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and are being tried together. Chauvin admitted guilt in December as part of a plea deal.\nAll three former officers will face a state trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder.\nKueng and Thao told US District Judge Paul Magnuson on Monday they planned to testify in their own defense.\nLane, the rookie officer who held down Floyd's legs during the fatal restraint, told the judge Tuesday that he also planned to take the stand. His attorney Earl Gray had told Magnuson a day earlier he wanted to speak with Lane about it before giving a final decision.\nKueng is expected to take the stand after Thao. Assistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell had been pressing Thao on his reasoning for not interfering in Chauvin's handling of Floyd, how often Thao faced toward his fellow officers during the restraint that lead to Floyd's death and whether Thao took any action to assess Floyd's medical condition, including when he was asked to do so by a bystander.\n\"Did you communicate to your partners what you were being told by the bystanders,\" Bell asked.\n\"No,\" Thao replied.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nBell also asked Thao if he knew when Floyd stopped breathing, but defense attorney Robert Paule objected to the question. It was one of a dozen objections during Wednesday morning's cross-examination. Bell seemingly became frustrated at the number of times she had to pause and rephrase her questions due to the number of objections.\n\"Did you hear him talking during the fifth minute or not?\" Bell pressed.\n\"It's a possibility,\" Thao said. When asked if he could confirm if he noticed Floyd's eyes were closed, Thao said he couldn't tell.\nBell continued asking Thao about his knowledge of Floyd's medical condition, of which Paule continued to vehemently object.\""}

MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Malaca\u00f1ang has described as \"misguided\" notions that booster shots are no longer necessary because of the declining COVID-19 case rates in the country.\n\nActing presidential spokesman Karlo Nograles said only about 29% of the 33.5 million persons who are qualified to receive booster shots have availed of their third jab as of February 20.\n\n\"Perhaps most of them are thinking: 'Why do we need this?' The number of COVID-19 cases in the country is going down. There is very little risk of getting COVID today.' Not true,\" Nograles said at a press briefing last Tuesday.\n\n\"This view is misguided. We still need additional protection. It is better to be safe than sorry,\" he added.\n\nNograles said it is worrisome that 23 million people in the country have yet to be given their boosters.\n\nThe health department has recommended the getting of boosters at least three months after the second shot of a primary two-dose vaccine or at least two months after the primary single-dose jab is given. According to recent studies, the efficacy of primary doses wanes after six to eight months, hence the need for booster shots.\n\nNograles assured the public that the COVID-19 vaccines being administered are safe and effective.\n\n\"Ito ay ating panlaban, hindi kalaban. Pansagip ng buhay, pambangon ng kabuhayan (This is our weapon, not our enemy. It can save lives and restore livelihood),\" he added.\n\nAs of February 21, about 62.65 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 while 9.78 million others have received their booster shots. \n\nThe government aims to fully vaccinate 90 million people before the end of June and to provide 72.16 milion booster shots to the adult population within the year."}

Deputies found two unconscious victims on the ground upon arriving at the scene and the camel was still on the loose, Sheriff Karl Jackson said Friday.\n\nIn audio obtained by CBS News, a dispatcher can be heard reporting \"two 911 calls of two people being viciously attacked by a camel at Shirley Farms.\"\n\nOfficials from multiple agencies responded to the incident and they attempted to provide aid to the victims and move them to a safe place. But Jackson said the camel attacked an Obion County Sheriff's Office vehicle before it moved towards the deputies who were transferring a victim to emergency medical services.\n\nAt that time officers put the camel down, Jackson said.\n\nThe two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. They have been identified as Bobby Matheny, 42, and Tommy Gunn, 67.\n\nShirley Farms told CBS News that they are upset and grieving about the attack and do not have further comment at this time.\nCan you summarize this into 2 concise bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "What does this text say about the differences between android and iOS?\n\nAndroid is a more open system as compared to iOS (iOS 10 included). Any Android app that is available even if it is not on the Google Play store can be downloaded and installed on an Android device.\n\nThis is not the case with iOS. Case in point: Apple will not allow you to view Flash videos and play Flash games on iOS devices for reasons only known to them.\n\nBecause Apple maintains such as tight grip on the applications that can be allowed on an iOS device, the devices are more secure.\n\nOn the other hand, the openness of the Android platform means that there is a bigger risk of not just malware but other security threats. This makes iOS devices a safer option for those who want a more secure device.\n\nApple takes the time to ensure that the interface is pleasant and well designed. Across all iOS devices you expect to find well designed products and Apple doesn't disappoint. But when it comes to being able to customize how the widgets will appear, Android devices offer you better control.\n\nAlso there is such a wide range of different Android devices that to change the interface you just need to select a different Android device.\n\nOn the other hand, Android devices have a considerably less battery life but again, there are so many different devices, meaning you can choose one with a better battery life.\n\nUsually iOS devices have better battery life as compared to Android devices. But unlike Android devices you cannot replace the battery yourself."}

In Portuguese, the zoo noted, Fofo means cute.\n\nPorcupines, perhaps as much as any creature, show the variety of forms allowed to animals. Many of us may know porcupines for their sharp quills, and so view them as prickly sorts.\n\nBut a March 4 zoo report on Fofo suggested an animal\u2019s personality may not reflect its structure. Fofo, the zoo said, is calm, gentle and good-natured \u2014 almost as if his conduct is guided by character rather than quills.\n\nThe birth process of these porcupines also seems to show nature\u2019s creativity. At birth, the zoo said, the quills are soft. They harden only after exposure to air."}

{"prompt": "A week after Stanford soccer captain Katie Meyer died by suicide, university officials have vowed to bring on additional mental health services.\n\nThe March 1 death of Meyer, 22, sent shockwaves through the community, as did the tragic deaths of three other students during the past year: Dylan Simmons, Jacob Meisel and Rose Wong.\n\nMeisel and Wong died by suicide, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\n\"Over the last year, the Stanford community has grieved the unimaginable loss of multiple members of our student family, and the past few weeks have been especially challenging and heartbreaking,\" the university said in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday.\n\nIn response, the university said it has begun recruiting for additional clinical counseling and therapy positions. And officials said the student affairs office plans to tap experts to brainstorm measures beyond clinical support. Over the last two years, Stanford increased its clinical staff by 20%, which officials said reduced wait times for those seeking services.\n\nThe move comes as students increasingly seek therapy and other wellness services on campus \u2014 a trend that saw a sharp spike during the pandemic. And there's evidence suicide attempts are increasing among young people. Meanwhile, colleges and universities are struggling to keep up with demand because of a shortage in mental health clinicians, California Healthline reports.\n\n\"Mental health remains not only an ongoing challenge but our most urgent priority,\" wrote Dee Mostofi, a spokesperson for the university, in an email.\n\nStanford officials said recent losses \"can feel especially overwhelming\" amid the ongoing pandemic and outbreak of war in Ukraine, and urged those struggling emotionally to reach out for help.\n\n\"For all in our community who are suffering, know that whatever feelings are arising in you are normal and need time to be felt,\" officials added. \"There\u2019s no one way or right way to grieve, and we are here to support each other as we find our own paths to healing.\"\n\nCan you summarize this with 2 bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Does this text give the movie a positive review?\n\nIt\u2019s been almost an entire decade since writer/director Ti West\u2018s last horror feature, The Sacrament. Far too long. Luckily, West ensures that the wait has been worth it with A24\u2019s X, an homage to the gritty indie horror of the \u201970s but with savage style and a deranged sense of humor that\u2019s pure Ti West. A deceptively simple setup gives way to a go-for-broke horror-comedy that leaves you breathless, both from laughter and nail-biting tension.\n\nSet in 1979 Texas, X opens to the aftermath of a bloodbath, to the befuddlement of local officials. Cut to 24 hours earlier, where a group of aspiring adult filmmakers load up in a van and drive from Houston out to the boonies to shoot. Producer Wayne (The Ring\u2019s Martin Henderson) attempts to cut every corner for their limited budget, first by securing a young cinephile to direct, RJ (Owen Campbell), who\u2019s brought girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) to assist and handle the boom mic. Wayne\u2019s enlisted his girlfriend Maxine (Mia Goth), Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and Jackson (Scott Mescudi) to star. Then he\u2019s rented a boarding house on the cheap from the reclusive, elder Howard (Stephen Ure), who warns them to stay out of his wife\u2019s sight.\n\nThe porn production quickly devolves into a fucked up horror picture when things spiral out of control.\n\nTi West's 'X' Highlights Horror Films Premiering at SXSW's 2022 Film Festival!\n\nWest has many surprises in store for X, but the first straight out of the gate is just how wickedly funny it is. From the little details like \u201cPlowing Service\u201d emblazoned across Wayne\u2019s van to the consistent tongue-in-cheek euphemisms befitting of the adult film production, X has a delightfully wicked sense of humor. Snow and Mescudi stand out for their line delivery and comedic timing; their character gags and one-liners land with perfection.\n\nThe second significant shock in store is how fiercely the filmmaker matches the comedy with the horror. While it\u2019s no surprise that West knows how to build tension, he brings it to a whole new level here. West, who co-edits with David Kashevaroff, finds ingenious and innovative ways to create edge-of-your-seat suspense through editing. Spliced scenes don\u2019t just create visual interest; they deliver potent scares. Overhead shots instill unease, a masterclass of terror and foreshadowing with gratifyingly intense payoffs later. West\u2019s intoxicating blend of style and scare-crafting creates a visceral horror experience.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the gore of it all. X is a crowd-pleasing doozy when it comes to brutal bloodletting and kills. Some deaths leave you queasy, and some will leave you cackling with glee. All of it is immensely satisfying.\n\nX is West firing on all cylinders. The commitment to the period is top-level, capturing the aesthetic and vibe without ever coming close to feeling pastiche. It\u2019s all the more impressive considering just how much humor gets injected, which could\u2019ve pushed this into spoof territory quickly in other hands. The editing is a masterclass, a marvel of how West structures this wild tale to maximize the tension or offer reprieve through an onslaught of terror.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cast. The lean, straightforward narrative gets straight to the goods and never wastes time on heavy exposition. It\u2019s all in the little details and the talented cast making these characters feel lived-in with a shared history. We root for this wacky, free-spirited bunch because they\u2019re so charming and genuine. Naturally, it lends well to the horror\u2019s impact.\n\nThe setting and period make for easy comparisons to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and West uses that to lull viewers before pulling the rug out from under them. They share similar DNA and pure grit, but it\u2019s a narratively different beast that demonstrates why West should be given full reign to go full throttle on deranged, savage, and intense horror-comedies more often. It\u2019s a blast.\n\nX releases in theaters on March 18, 2022."}

This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. They also won the Ted Hughes Award for their play Brand New Ancients in 2013."}
{"prompt": "Summarise this news article into one succinct paragraph: \nBERGAMO, Italy, March 12 (Reuters) - Italian police have seized a superyacht owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, the prime minister's office said on Saturday, a few days after the businessman was placed on an EU sanctions list following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 143-metre (470-foot) Sailing Yacht A, which has a price tag of 530 million euros ($578 million), has been sequestered at the northern port of Trieste, the government said.\n\nDesigned by Philippe Starck and built by Nobiskrug in Germany, the vessel is the world's biggest sailing yacht, the government said.\n\nMelnichenko owned major fertiliser producer EuroChem Group and coal company SUEK. The companies said in statements on Thursday that he had resigned as a member of the board in both companies and withdrawn as their beneficiary, effective Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Melnichenko, Alex Andreev, said the businessman had \"no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine. He has no political affiliations\".\n\n\"There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on the EU sanctions list,\" Andreev said. \"We will be disputing these baseless and unjustified sanctions, and believe that the rule of law and common sense will prevail.\n\nSince last week Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth more than 700 million euros ($763.63 million) from high-profile Russians who have been placed on the EU sanctions list, Economy Minister Daniele Franco said on Saturday."}

Possibly one of the best popular music documentaries of our time. \"Get Back\" chronicles the January 1969 Beatles \"Let It Be\" project from start to finish, including the creativity, fun, crisis, and uncertainty about what the project was actually going to be about. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings/Hobbit) does a remarkable job taking us on this often bumpy journey. His 6-hour rockumentary shows The Beatles emerging triumphant by the end - giving a free concert for the whole of the London Business District from the rooftop of their Apple building at 3 Saville Row. The main takeaway is - these four guys genuinely loved and respected each other. Their interpersonal relationships, when seen through Jackon's lens, are far more positive than the previous negativity put forth in the heavily-edited Let It Be film (United Artists 1970). \"Get Back\" is highly recommended for any Beatles fan...or anyone who wants to take an in-depth journey back to the late 1960's and get a rare glimpse at their creative process.

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- standing trial in federal court for violating Floyd's civil rights.\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyds death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nFirst of the officers involved in George Floyd's death testifies that using a knee to restrain a subject was a common Minneapolis PD practice\nAll three are each charged with deprivation of rights under color of law as Chauvin restrained Floyd. Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, resulting in Floyd's death. The three have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and are being tried together. Chauvin admitted guilt in December as part of a plea deal.\nAll three former officers will face a state trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder.\nKueng and Thao told US District Judge Paul Magnuson on Monday they planned to testify in their own defense.\nLane, the rookie officer who held down Floyd's legs during the fatal restraint, told the judge Tuesday that he also planned to take the stand. His attorney Earl Gray had told Magnuson a day earlier he wanted to speak with Lane about it before giving a final decision.\nKueng is expected to take the stand after Thao. Assistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell had been pressing Thao on his reasoning for not interfering in Chauvin's handling of Floyd, how often Thao faced toward his fellow officers during the restraint that lead to Floyd's death and whether Thao took any action to assess Floyd's medical condition, including when he was asked to do so by a bystander.\n\"Did you communicate to your partners what you were being told by the bystanders,\" Bell asked.\n\"No,\" Thao replied.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao is pictured in a courtroom sketch testifying at his trial in the killing of George Floyd on Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\nBell also asked Thao if he knew when Floyd stopped breathing, but defense attorney Robert Paule objected to the question. It was one of a dozen objections during Wednesday morning's cross-examination. Bell seemingly became frustrated at the number of times she had to pause and rephrase her questions due to the number of objections.\n\"Did you hear him talking during the fifth minute or not?\" Bell pressed.\n\"It's a possibility,\" Thao said. When asked if he could confirm if he noticed Floyd's eyes were closed, Thao said he couldn't tell.\nBell continued asking Thao about his knowledge of Floyd's medical condition, of which Paule continued to vehemently object.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below in three concise sentences that you feel best describe the article as a whole:\n\nSaharan sands float north to Europe, coating cities with dust\n\nThe sandstorm, known as a calima in Spain, began covering much of the Iberian Peninsula on Tuesday morning, blanketing cars and buildings in a thick red dust and making it harder to breathe in the stiflingly dry air.\n\nA calima occurs when a burst of dusty, warm wind forms during sandstorms in the Sahara and then crosses over from the African desert. With rain forecast in Madrid on Thursday morning, residents were bracing themselves for a muddy rain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much that can be done at this stage,\u201d said Miguel Serrano, a porter in Madrid, who said he had been busy sweeping dust outside his building Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s now see whether the rain helps clean it up or at least makes the air more pleasant.\u201d\n\nWhile Spain\u2019s skies tended toward the apocalyptic, with blood orange colours reminiscent of areas besieged by wildfires, the effects were more subtle elsewhere.\n\nFrom the Swiss Alps to Britain, residents of countries far from the Sahara looked out their windows Wednesday and noticed something slightly off. It was not the end times, sky-on-fire hues of Spain, but rather a vague sense that this is not how it usually is.\n\nIn London, it was as if the skies had been run through a sepia-toned filter, a slightly unsettling aura that could easily be taken as a harbinger of nothing good. It was the grey-orange colour the sky would be in a movie about a town recovering from nuclear fallout.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon isn\u2019t new, the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service described this week\u2019s events as \u201can exceptional Saharan dust episode,\u201d with \u201cvery high concentrations of coarse particulate matter.\u201d\n\nMark Parrington, a senior scientist at the service, said it was not unusual in February and March for wind to kick up sand in the Sahara, sending it on an international voyage as far away as South America. There were traces of Saharan dust in Britain last year as well, he said.\n\nBut it is typically not as noticeable as it has been this week, he said. The storm was stronger because of \u201cweather patterns being in the right configuration to bring it directly into Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the coming days, the dust is expected to move north through Europe, reaching as far as Denmark, before fading by the weekend, the monitoring service said.\n\n\u201cThe current concentrations of particulate matter in the transports are exceptionally high, and some studies predict that climate change will result in even more intense Saharan dust storms in the future,\u201d the service said in a statement. It added that the storms would threaten to worsen air quality, affect the frequency of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and speed the decline of glaciers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spain\u2019s health ministry called the sandstorm an emergency situation and issued a warning to residents to stay indoors and keep doors and windows shut to avoid inhaling particles, particularly people with existing breathing problems. The ministry also warned drivers to show caution because of diminished visibility. Overall, the ministry said people should \u201creduce all outdoor activity.\u201d\n\nSpain is often on the front line of winds and storms coming from the Sahara and Sahel deserts because it is separated from Morocco only by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar. Still, weather experts said that it was rare for the calima to hit Madrid and other parts of central or northern Spain with such intensity.\n\nEpisodes of calima are, however, relatively common in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the northwestern coast of Africa. In February 2020, the Canary Islands were hit by their worst sandstorm in 40 years, forcing airports to close at a time of year when the islands receive many tourists from northern Europe seeking a mild winter climate."}

At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.[13] The nation consists of the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into TWO SHORT sentences:\n\nWhat Do Men Want? by Nina Power; A History of Masculinity by Ivan Jablonka \u2013 reviews\n\nAfew years ago, I sat through an enjoyable lecture by the artist Grayson Perry about the familiar evils of rigid ideas of masculinity: war, imperialism, misogyny, alienation. The lecture was part of a festival called Being a Man (or BAM! for less evolved members of the tribe). Perry ended his comments with a scribbled series of demands on a whiteboard for a new bill of men\u2019s rights, with which it was hard to argue. \u201cWe men ask ourselves and each other for the following: the right to be vulnerable, to be uncertain, to be wrong, to be intuitive, the right not to know, to be flexible and not to be ashamed.\u201d He insisted that men sit down and mostly talk quietly to achieve these aims and was given a rousing standing ovation.\n\nThe need for men to be vulnerable, to open up about their insecurities \u2013 to become, in cliched terms, more like women \u2013 is certainly one antidote to what has become widely understood as the current crisis in masculinity. Thinking about that lecture afterwards, though, it felt a bit limited as a solution. There is no question that mansplainers and manspreaders could do with a fatal dose of humility and doubt. But what about that generation of young men who already feel marginalised from a consumer society, who have been denied most of the markers that traditionally help boys become men: decent jobs, responsible dads, stable homes of their own and, often in consequence, meaningful adult relationships. Would opening up about doubt and vulnerability in itself allow them to achieve self-worth and purpose?\n\nNina Power\u2019s provocative and rigorous book addresses some of those questions from a traditional feminist perspective. When she asked her male friends the question in her book\u2019s title, \u201cWhat do men want?\u201d, most of them played up to stereotypes: \u201cto be left alone\u201d, \u201cpussy\u201d, \u201ca shed\u201d, \u201cNigella Lawson\u201d. While she analyses the predictable adolescence of such responses and what might lie behind them, she is more interested in the aspiration of a single one of her mates: \u201cto be a good man\u201d. What, today, might that look like?\n\nPower, an academic philosopher whose previous book, One Dimensional Woman, was a critique of the limits to choice for women in a capitalist world, begins with a few truisms that our political times have made controversial. \u201cCertain things should be clear from the outset,\u201d she writes, \u201cto be a man is not in itself a bad thing.\u201d And then, in a statement of considerable bravery, at least in certain social media circles: \u201cI believe that the difference between the sexes is real and important on every level of our collective being... sex has a historical as well as a biological reality. It is destructive to everyone to pretend that is not true.\u201d\n\nThe history, she insists, is as important as the biology. While it is at best naive to imagine that any society can, overnight, usefully be reconstructed on gender-neutral grounds (however desirable that outcome), it would truly be absurd to imagine that \u201ceverything that our ancestors understood [about men and women] is irrelevant\u201d. Rather, she insists, \u201cwe would do well to revisit old values and virtues\u201d in order to \u201clive together better\u201d.\n\nIn this context Power examines some of the extreme manifestations of the broken relationship between the sexes. She looks at the economic and cultural circumstances as well as the disturbingly warped psychology that produce \u201cincel\u201d (involuntary celibate) groups, or the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) movement. In addressing this damaged thinking she refuses easy essentialist answers about toxic masculinity or any simplistic notions of patriarchy. She will not, for example, wholly dismiss the appeal of a figure such as Jordan Peterson, who offers the promise of basic structure and meaning in profoundly unstructured and meaningless male lives. If men are to reclaim an idea of \u201cvirility\u201d \u2013 in its original Greek sense of acting with virtue, of living with grace and due responsibility \u2013 it will, she argues, not be done by hashtags alone. \u201cOur age often promotes, inculcates and celebrates infantilism and complaint,\u201d she writes; #KillAllMen will get women \u2013 and men \u2013 nowhere.\n\nAnother book, on a similar subject, from the same publisher, is not quite so convinced. Ivan Jablonka\u2019s history of masculinity became something of a surprise bestseller in France. Jablonka adopts a much wider lens in analysing the problem with men, one that begins in the division of labour in paleolithic societies and runs through the ultimate mansplaining prophets of the Abrahamic religions to take in pop music lyrics and English boarding schools. \u201cOnce the end of men has been diagnosed,\u201d Jablonka writes, in spirited translation, \u201cmen can be reinvented as fair and just.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to his long prehistory, men, he believes, are suddenly \u201ccapable of renouncing the brawny male, the brute, the swine in us. And when we have made cracks in the masculinities of domination, out of them will come human beings rid of their little game of virility.\u201d Jablonka presents himself as a humble conduit for that revolution. \u201cWhat am I doing here, amid the feminist struggle?\u201d he wonders, \u201cis it possible to fight the patriarchy as a man?\u201d His 354 pages make the profoundly confident Gallic case for that new humility \u2013 but Nina Power\u2019s slimmer volume makes a much more urgent claim to any spare man hours."}

In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature, winning the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.\n\nDespite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, \"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\"[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \"every adult should read before they die\".[3]"}
{"prompt": "What does this text say about the new Samsung OLED TV?\n\nSamsung announced the pre-order availability of several flagship TV models shown at CES 2022 earlier this year, but buried at the bottom of its press release were three words that immediately caught my attention: Samsung OLED TV.\n\nThe writeup was rather vague, but after some back and forth, the company confirmed that the Samsung OLED TV (S95B) uses the hugely anticipated QD-OLED screen technology. The naming will likely cause confusion but the idea seems to be that OLED is already a household name, and now Samsung wants people to associate it with its brand, not the Korean rival who has dominated the OLED TV space in recent years.\n\nQD-OLED combines the best of Quantum Dot with the best of OLED to create infinite contrast ratios, perfect black levels, and high brightness levels. You can learn more about the technology in our QD-OLED guide but the short version is that quantum dots sit on a separate layer in front of an OLED one and emit blue light to illuminate pixels that contain red and green quantum dots. Each pixel is essentially converted into three subpixels, covering red, green, and blue, which can be combined to create true white light.\n\nThough it breaks new ground for Samsung, the Samsung OLED TV isn\u2019t the first device with QD-OLED tech. Sony unveiled at CES 2022 its Bravia A95K which also uses QD-OLED and Alienware released a monitor with the same panel tech. It is rather unusual for Samsung to be so coy about what could be one of its most important releases of the year. Whatever the case for that, this is big news for the TV industry.\n\nNow, back to the TV itself. Samsung OLED uses the same Neural Quantum Processor found in the Neo 8K for optimizing upscaled images. It runs on Tizen, an easy-to-navigate proprietary TV OS found on most Samsung sets. The company is also touting the OLED TV\u2019s sound quality, which supports Object Tracking Sound and Dolby Atmos for a surround sound effect and Q-Sympathy for playing audio through your TV and soundbar simultaneously.\n\nOf note is an \u201cOLED brightness booster.\u201d Samsung didn\u2019t provide brightness ratings, but this feature sounds encouraging. One downside of OLED panels is that they don\u2019t get as bright as backlit panels\u2013a flaw QD-OLED should resolve. The new hybrid technology isn\u2019t the only thing that could make you consider upgrading your current TV as the Samsung OLED also supports HDR10+ and has a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nAs for the design, Samsung is calling it \u201cLaserSlim\u201d because it is as thin as a laser beam...I guess? Anyway, the TV does look extremely thin (1.6 inches without the stand) based on the photos Samsung provided. On the rear are four HDMI ports all of which support 4K at 120Hz, which could make this a good option for gaming.\n\nThe Samsung OLED S95B is available for pre-order today in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, with prices set at $2,399 and $3,499, respectively. Sony\u2019s versions come in the same sizes but pricing has yet to be released."}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about Google's new ability?\n\nGoogle is finally releasing a \"delete history\" feature, which will wipe out the last 15 minutes of search queries, for the Android Google Search app. \"Delete history\" was announced at Google I/O 2021 in May and made it to the iOS app two months later, but for some reason, it took almost a year to come to Android. It's finally rolling out now, though, according to a statement Google gave to The Verge over the weekend.\n\nIf you want to wipe out the last few minutes of your search history, open the Google Search app via the app icon (other entry points, like the search bar widget, won't bring up the right UI), tap on your profile picture in the top right and you should see a new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option at the top of the pop-up menu. If you don't see the setting yet, try swiping the app away in recent apps and opening it again, which will load the newest configuration from the cloud.\n\nWiping out your search history is sort of like wiping out browser history, but Google stores search history to your account in the cloud. As the app explains, Google Search history tracks \"the things you search for, results you click, and stories you read\" while using the Google app or Google.com. Google also captures your location, plus audio recordings if you run a voice search. The search terms are used to show more relevant ads, of course, but also for future search predictions and to display content in Google Discover.\n\nThe control for search history is under the \"Web & App Activity\" feature. In the app, you can control this setting by tapping on the \"search history\" button just above the new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option, or you can head to myactivity.google.com in a browser. Web & App Activity can be turned off completely, or you can set the system to \"auto-delete\" your data older than three, 18, or 36 months."}

Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.\nAdd the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving."}

He is considered as the national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines.[8][9] An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.\n\nHe was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution, inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to Philippine independence.\n\nHe is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero.[9] He was the author of the novels Noli Me T\u00e1ngere and El filibusterismo, and a number of poems and essays.[10][1"}

Cool the burn. Immediately immerse the burn in cool tap water or apply cold, wet compresses. Do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides.\n\n2. Apply petroleum jelly two to three times daily. Do not apply ointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn, as these may cause an infection. Do not apply topical antibiotics.\n\n3. Cover the burn with a nonstick, sterile bandage. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered. Do not pop the blisters.\n\n4. Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation.\n\n5. Protect the area from the sun. Once the burn heals, protect the area from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. This will help minimize scarring, as the redness from a burn sometimes persists for weeks, especially in those with darker skin tones."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this article for me? I just want to know if I should continue to vape or not \"1: Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it\u2019s still not safe.\nE-cigarettes heat nicotine (extracted from tobacco), flavorings and other chemicals to create an aerosol that you inhale. Regular tobacco cigarettes contain 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic. While we don\u2019t know exactly what chemicals are in e-cigarettes, Blaha says \u201cThere\u2019s almost no doubt that vaping exposes you to fewer toxic chemicals than smoking traditional cigarettes.\u201d\n\nHowever, there has been an outbreak of lung injuries and deaths associated with vaping. In February 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 2,807 cases of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and 68 deaths attributed to that condition.\n\n\u201cThese cases appear to predominantly affect people who modify their vaping devices or use black market modified e-liquids. This is especially true for vaping products containing THC,\u201d explains Blaha.\n\nThe CDC has identified vitamin E acetate as a chemical of concern among people with EVALI. Vitamin E acetate is a thickening agent often used in THC vaping products, and it was found in all lung fluid samples of EVALI patients examined by the CDC.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people:\n\nDo not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products.\nAvoid using informal sources, such as friends, family or online dealers to obtain a vaping device.\nDo not modify or add any substances to a vaping device that are not intended by the manufacturer.\nResearch from The Johns Hopkins University on vape ingredients published in October 2021 reveals thousands of chemical ingredients in vape products, most of which are not yet identified. Among those the team could identify were several potentially harmful substances, including caffeine, three chemicals never previously found in e-cigarettes, a pesticide and two flavorings linked with possible toxic effects and respiratory irritation.\n\n2: Research suggests vaping is bad for your heart and lungs.\nNicotine is the primary agent in regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and it is highly addictive. It causes you to crave a smoke and suffer withdrawal symptoms if you ignore the craving. Nicotine is a toxic substance. It raises your blood pressure and spikes your adrenaline, which increases your heart rate and the likelihood of having a heart attack.\n\nIs vaping bad for you? There are many unknowns about vaping, including what chemicals make up the vapor and how they affect physical health over the long term. \u201cPeople need to understand that e-cigarettes are potentially dangerous to your health,\u201d says Blaha. \u201cEmerging data suggests links to chronic lung disease and asthma, as well as associations between dual use of e-cigarettes and smoking with cardiovascular disease. You\u2019re exposing yourself to all kinds of chemicals that we don\u2019t yet understand and that are probably not safe.\u201d\n\n3: Electronic cigarettes are just as addictive as traditional ones.\nBoth e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes contain nicotine, which research suggests may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine. What\u2019s worse, says Blaha, many e-cigarette users get even more nicotine than they would from a combustible tobacco product: Users can buy extra-strength cartridges, which have a higher concentration of nicotine, or increase the e-cigarette\u2019s voltage to get a greater hit of the substance. 4: Electronic cigarettes aren\u2019t the best smoking cessation tool.\nAlthough they\u2019ve been promoted as an aid to help you quit smoking, e-cigarettes have not received Food and Drug Administration approval as smoking cessation devices. A recent study found that most people who intended to use e-cigarettes to kick the nicotine habit ended up continuing to use traditional and e-cigarettes.\n\nIn light of the EVALI outbreak, the CDC advises people who use e-cigarettes for smoking cessation to weigh the risks and benefits and first consider use of other FDA-approved smoking cessation options.\n\n5: A new generation is getting hooked on nicotine.\nAmong youth, e-cigarettes, especially the disposable kind, are more popular than any traditional tobacco product. According to the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 2 million U.S. middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2021, with more than 8 in 10 of those youth using flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nAccording to Blaha, there are three reasons e-cigarettes may be particularly enticing to young people. First, many teens believe vaping is less harmful than smoking. Second, e-cigarettes have a lower per-use cost than traditional cigarettes. Finally, youths and adults find the lack of smoke appealing. With no smell, e-cigarettes reduce some of the stigma of smoking.\n\n\u201cWhat I find most concerning about the rise of vaping is that people who would\u2019ve never smoked otherwise, especially youth, are taking up the habit,\u201d says Blaha. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you convert from cigarette smoking to vaping. It\u2019s quite another thing to start up nicotine use with vaping. And, getting hooked on nicotine often leads to using traditional tobacco products down the road.\u201d\n\nResearch from the CDC shows that vaping among youth has declined somewhat since 2020. Kids being stuck at home under their parents\u2019 supervision during the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to that trend.\n\nBut, Blaha says, interpreting the data is tricky, since young people change their preferences often, and, when surveyed, may not consider using disposable products such as \u201cpuff bars\u201d as vaping. The same CDC report says disposable e-cigarette use has increased 1,000% among high school students and 400% among middle school students since 2019.\""}

If you were even born, that is.\n\nThis is what The Strong has to say about Ocarina of Time:\n\nReleased for the Nintendo 64 gaming console in 1998, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time defined what a 3D action video game could be, influencing countless games that followed. The game\u2019s combination of storytelling, puzzle-solving, and combat earned Ocarina of Time multiple \u201cGame of the Year\u201d awards in 1998. The game sold more than 7.6 million copies worldwide, and it continues to be recognized by players and critics alike as one of the best video games ever made.\n\nNintendo has historically done very well with inductees into the Hall of Fame. Last year, Animal Crossing earned a spot, and other winners include Super Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros.\n\nWe'll find out whether Ocarina of Time makes it into the Hall of Fame on 5th May. In the meantime, you can read up on all the nominees, as well as look at attending, on The Strong's website."}

{"prompt": "\u201cLook at ya\u2019, with that Family Dollar Store shirt on.\u201d\n\nMy high school classmate meant that as an insult \u2013 and I took it as one - because in high school, near about everything we said to each other was meant as an insult.\n\nSo I lied and reflexively replied \u201cNaw it ain\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPssst: It was.\n\nToday? I\u2019d embrace the \u201cinsult,\u201d but at 15 \u2013 when you don\u2019t want to stand out from your peers in any way \u2013 being outed for wearing cheap clothes made you an object of ridicule.\n\nI\u2019m just glad that there was no social media in those days, because instead of saying it to me, that friend would have posted it on Twitter or Facebook and I\u2019d have had to leave school for the day or forever.\n\nThat had already happened once before, after the Natural Four performed on Soul Train one Saturday and I, smitten by their funky hairstyle, showed up at Richmond Senior High School on Monday with my hair permed, too.\n\nIt was in the bathroom before first period when my pal Raymond gawked at my new \u2019do and inquired \u201cWhat the hell\u2019d you do to yer hair?\u201d\n\nI left school immediately, went home and spent the next several hours washing Murray\u2019s hair pomade out of it.\n\nWhat\u2019s that got to do with my Family Dollar Stores shirt?\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson recently blamed such \u201cdollar stores\u201d for messing up the environment.\n\n\u201cAmerica is getting much dirtier and there are like Dollar Stores everywhere and people litter... Maybe it\u2019s an intentional effort to weaken the country, maybe they just don\u2019t like America...\u201d\n\nDollar stores are, he said \u201ca blot on God\u2019s creation.\u201d\n\nSorry, old bean, but we can\u2019t all be related to heiresses of the Swanson frozen food fortune.\n\nThe poor in America have always been demonized, but don\u2019t they, too, deserve to be able to shop in a nice store, to clothe and feed their families?\n\nCharlotte can lay claim to the first Family Dollar Store, which would be followed by more than 8,200 others, but the family that started it got its business start in Rockingham.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why I was insulted when Carlson blamed them for messing up the environment.\n\nJ. Neal Cadieu, publisher of the Richmond County Daily Journal when I worked there in the 1980s, was an adolescent paperboy there in the 1940s when his father was publisher.\n\n\u201cI remember Minnie and Harry,\u201d he said, speaking of the parents of Leon Levine, Family Dollar\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cAt the time, they owned the Hub\u201d clothing store downtown, he said, and Harry Levine and he had a little business tete-a\u2019-tete they\u2019d perform when he went in to collect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d walk in and Harry \u2013 of course, I called him Mr. Levine - would say \u2018I\u2019ve already paid you, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 I would pull out my book and look and say \u2018No, you didn\u2019t,\u2019 and he\u2019d laugh, say \u2018I was just kidding,\u2019 pull out the dime and hand it to me...\n\nDespite my denial of my shirt\u2019s provenance, Family Dollar Stores in the 1960s and 1970s helped a whole lot of working class people stay clothed.\n\nBack before the chain seemingly switched its emphasis to household goods and cleaning supplies and Funyons, you could get an entire outfit for $6. I know that because, when the store opened in Rockingham, it boasted \u201cnothing over $3.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think that a $3 shirt and pair of britches wouldn\u2019t last very long, but they did. The clothes were inexpensive, not cheap.\n\nSure, once when I put on a brand new pair of corduroy pants from there, the button popped off with such velocity that people over in Hamlet were ducking, but that often happened regardless of where I bought my pants.\n\nI, for one, still appreciate dollar stores, and consider neither them or the people who shop there \u201ca blot on God\u2019s creation.\u201d\n\nFor many, they are a blessing.\nCan you please write a more concise and professional summary?"}

{"prompt": "Can you tell me about the Primate Forest that the zoo is creating?\n\nThe Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has revealed details of the \"major announcement\" they had been teasing as it will create the Primate Forest, a 140,000-square-foot indoor destination that will serve as the new home for the park's gorillas and orangutans. It will also \"transform and significantly expand\" the zoo's existing RainForest attraction.\n\nThe Primate Forest will be a \"multi-year, multi-phased project\" that zoo officials hope to begin construction on as early as next year. The total cost has not yet been determined as construction plans continue to be finalized. The Cleveland Zoological Society is actively fundraising for the project, which is expected to be funded primarily by philanthropic donations.  \n\nZoo officials say the initial expansion will be centered around the two-story CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery, a new entranceway to the Primate Forest \"that will immerse guests in the wonders of the natural world through interactive technology, multi-story play structures and more.\"\n\n\u201cThe partnership with CrossCountry Mortgage is catalytic to bringing a truly transformative experience to Cleveland,\u201d said Cleveland Metroparks CEO Brian M. Zimmerman in a statement. \u201cThe new CrossCountry Mortgage Forest Gallery and yet to be named Primate Forest habitats will connect our guests with wildlife like never before.\u201d\n\nThe Primate Forest will also add two new expansive, multi-story habitats for gorillas and orangutans. This comes after Cleveland Metroparks Zoo celebrated the birth last year of both a baby gorilla and baby orangutan, two of the world\u2019s most endangered primates. The Primate Forest will also incorporate the more than 10,000 plants and more than 600 animals that currently live in the rainforest through additional enhancements."}

{"prompt": "Please parse the following - Associazione Sportiva Roma (BIT: ASR, LSE: 0MT1; Rome Sport Association), commonly referred to as Roma (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8ro\u02d0ma]), is an Italian professional football club based in Rome. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for the 1951\u201352 season. Roma have won Serie A three times, in 1941\u201342, 1982\u201383 and 2000\u201301, as well as nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In European competitions, Roma has won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960\u201361 and were runners-up in the 1983\u201384 European Cup and the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup.\n\nFifteen players have won the FIFA World Cup while playing at Roma: Attilio Ferraris and Enrique Guaita (1934); Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio (1934 and 1938); Aldo Donati and Pietro Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi Voller and Thomas Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Vincent Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta and Francesco Totti (2006).\n\nSince 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue they share with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the second-largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plan to move to a new stadium, though it is yet to start construction. Having a strong local rivalry, Roma and Lazio contest Derby della Capitale.\n\nThe club's home colours are carmine red and golden yellow, which gives Roma their nickname \"I Giallorossi\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\"). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome."}
{"prompt": "I am wondering if you can make an ingredient list out of these recipe instructions?                                                                                                     Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.\nAdd the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this news article for me?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration is set to extend the federal public transportation mask mandate for another 30 days, an administration official told CNN, pointing to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mandate is one of the last remaining broad requirements that Americans wear masks in public places. It applies to mass transportation including planes, trains, buses and hubs like airports.\n\nThe official\u2019s comments came after CNN reported that federal officials began notifying stakeholders in the airline industry of the upcoming announcement. Three sources, including two industry officials and a government official, described the conversations to CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe requirement, which now extends to April 18, was previously set to expire a week from Friday, and the policy will be reviewed over the next month, the official said.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, CDC will work with government agencies to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis revised framework will be based on the Covid-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. We will communicate any updates publicly if and/or when they change.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that means the CDC may ultimately allow the mandate to lift before the 30-day period is up if transmission rates of the virus nationwide drop to low enough levels.\n\nThe federal announcement comes as many state and local mask mandates have been dropped or are set to be rescinded.\n\nIn the skies, requiring masks has proven to be a divisive issue. Flight crew unions applauded the measure for protecting flight attendants who can not avoid close contact with scores of passengers.\n\nBut some passengers refused, leading to more than 4,800 reports to the Federal Aviation Administration of passengers who turned disruptive or violent while flouting the mask rule. The agency adopted a zero-tolerance approach to in-flight outbursts, which surged during the pandemic.\n\nSome in the airline industry have described a concern about lifting the mandate too soon, ahead of another wave of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t want is to lift the mandate and have to reimpose it,\u201d one of the sources told CNN."}

It was sold for 25 cents a copy, with a discount for bulk orders of 100 copies or more.[1]\n\nThe Johns Committee had for several years conducted a witch hunt for homosexuals in public schools, universities, and state government agencies, believing they were part of a Communist strategy to \"subvert the American way of life by controlling academic institutions and by corrupting the nation's moral fiber.\" By publishing its findings, the Committee hoped to persuade the Legislature to enact comprehensive anti-homosexual legislation, and to \"shock Floridians into accepting its program.\"[1]"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain this text to me in 3 sentences?\n\nCertain animals hibernate because food supplies become scarce during the winter months. By going into a long deep sleep, they bypass this period completely, waking up when food becomes more plentiful.\n\nBears are most commonly associated with hibernation (although they are not considered true hibernators, because their body temperature doesn\u2019t lower significantly), but a variety of animals take advantage of this evolved adaptation, including the jumping mouse, little brown bat, eastern chipmunk, woodchuck, and certain species of ground squirrels. At least one bird is known to be a hibernator\u2014the poorwill, which lives in western North America.\n\nIt is believed that a compound in the blood of hibernators known as HIT (Hibernation Induction Trigger) lets animals know when it\u2019s time to prepare for hibernation. Shorter days, diminishing food supplies, and colder temperatures all appear to influence HIT, though the exact mechanism remains a mystery.\n\nHibernators tend to eat a lot of extra food in the fall in anticipation of their winter slumber and build significant stores of white and brown body fat to tide them over. Brown fat provides extra body heat as well as needed energy when the animal wakes up. Some animals also store food in their dens to consume during brief periods of wakefulness.\n\nHibernation is nothing like a regular night\u2019s sleep. In fact, significant physical changes occur within the body during the hibernation period. An animal\u2019s body temperature plunges, and its respiration and heart rate slow dramatically. The effect can be so extreme that a hibernating animal may appear dead.\n\nSeveral factors can influence hibernation. In regions where the winter is relatively mild, animals may hibernate for only brief periods or not at all. During periods of long hibernation, many animals will rouse briefly to go to the bathroom and eat a snack before falling asleep again. Certain species of bears are unique in that they do not awaken, eat, drink, or go to the bathroom during their hibernation period, which can last several months."}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about Google's new ability?\n\nGoogle is finally releasing a \"delete history\" feature, which will wipe out the last 15 minutes of search queries, for the Android Google Search app. \"Delete history\" was announced at Google I/O 2021 in May and made it to the iOS app two months later, but for some reason, it took almost a year to come to Android. It's finally rolling out now, though, according to a statement Google gave to The Verge over the weekend.\n\nIf you want to wipe out the last few minutes of your search history, open the Google Search app via the app icon (other entry points, like the search bar widget, won't bring up the right UI), tap on your profile picture in the top right and you should see a new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option at the top of the pop-up menu. If you don't see the setting yet, try swiping the app away in recent apps and opening it again, which will load the newest configuration from the cloud.\n\nWiping out your search history is sort of like wiping out browser history, but Google stores search history to your account in the cloud. As the app explains, Google Search history tracks \"the things you search for, results you click, and stories you read\" while using the Google app or Google.com. Google also captures your location, plus audio recordings if you run a voice search. The search terms are used to show more relevant ads, of course, but also for future search predictions and to display content in Google Discover.\n\nThe control for search history is under the \"Web & App Activity\" feature. In the app, you can control this setting by tapping on the \"search history\" button just above the new \"delete last 15 minutes\" option, or you can head to myactivity.google.com in a browser. Web & App Activity can be turned off completely, or you can set the system to \"auto-delete\" your data older than three, 18, or 36 months."}

The gunman, Miami-Dade authorities confirm, was wearing a black hoodie at the time of the shooting.\nA newly unsealed arrest warrant, obtained by WTVJ and the Miami Herald, alleges Martinez arranged Jones' murder, after the young mother agreed to testify against Martinez and two others, the outlets say.\nThe reports indicate that the warrant accuses Martinez of paying Carter to carry out the hit using federal funds obtained from a $15,000 COVID-related PPP loan.\n\"Bank statements were obtained which show a series of withdrawals of over $10,000 in cash and/or payments which occurs over the following days leading up to the homicide,\" WTVJ quotes from the warrant.\nRomiel Robinson, Jasmine Martinez, and Javon Carter\nThe warrant reportedly alleges a video was recovered from Carter's phone from the day of the shooting, showing him counting a large amount of cash, and bragging, \"Just another day at the office.\"\nThe warrant alleges Robinson \u2014 Martinez's new boyfriend \u2014 brokered the price for the killing with Carter, per the outlets.\nCarter and Robinson remain in jail without bond."}

{"prompt": "Please can you summarize the article below into two concise sentences:\n\nBanksy\u2019s View of \u2018Brexit\u2019? It\u2019s in the Stars\n\nLONDON \u2014 The three-story mural showing a workman chipping away at one of the 12 stars of the European Union flag appeared mysteriously in Dover, England, over the weekend, at once banal and symbolically poignant.\n\nBefore the paint had dried, social media was swirling with the well-trodden guessing game as to whether the intricate stenciled imagery belonged to Banksy, the enigmatic and anonymous guerrilla street artist whose work has graced walls from Britain to the West Bank.\n\nThe mystery was solved when Banksy posted photographs of the work on his official Instagram feed on Sunday, perhaps timed to coincide with the French presidential vote \u2014 which, as it turned out, the young and ardently pro-European Union former investment banker Emmanuel Macron won decisively.\n\nThe election solidified France\u2019s place at the center of the European Union and highlighted Britain\u2019s position on the outside looking in.\n\nThe timing and location of the installation infused it with added resonance. Britons will vote next month in a general election that Prime Minister Theresa May has justified on the grounds that it will buttress her position in tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey ought to make it the Brexit logo,\u201d a resident of Dover, where a majority voted to leave the bloc, told the website kentnews.co.uk. (The stars in the circle are intended to symbolize unity and do not refer to the number of member states.)\n\nOthers were less impressed. \u201cIs it really Banksy?\u201d Jan Honza Zicha wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember time when he was \u2018on to subject\u2019 before anyone else or at least part of the first liners. Unfortunately this time, he is about 10 months too late and the art work is truly ... well obvious and uninnovative.\u201d\n\nMalcolm John Haines wrote on Facebook, \u201cAnother boring piece of \u2018art\u2019 from the left wing\u2019s favourite millionaire luvvie.\u201d\n\nBut Mel Lloyd, an ecologist, lauded the strategic placement of the mural, on a building next to the A20, a main road not far from the Dover ferry terminal, one of the country\u2019s main gateways to Europe. \u201cHuge, fabulous, strategically placed new Banksyesque graffiti in Dover on A20,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTraffic leaving Dover Port will see this.\u201d\n\nBanksy, whose zealous guarding of his identity helps maintain interest in his work, is no stranger to political art.\n\nIn 2015, he created several artworks at a ramshackle migrant camp in Calais, France, known as the Jungle, where thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere lived while trying to find a way to reach Britain. One work showed the Apple founder Steve Jobs, an apparent reminder that Mr. Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBanksy attracted praise and ridicule two years ago after he unveiled a satirical exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England. The exhibition featured, among other things, mock security guards instructed to frown; a work showing a woman on a park bench being attacked by sea gulls; and a wreck of Cinderella\u2019s carriage, complete with Cinderella dangling lifelessly out of the carriage while surrounded by paparazzi, an image seemingly calculated to recall the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMore recently, the artist opened the Walled Off Hotel near the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank, offering rooms as well as what the hotel claims is the \u201cworst view in the world.\u201d The project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Parse the following text and tell me how the AI will be defined as aligned - Contemporary AI models can be difficult to understand, predict, and control. These problems can lead to significant harms when AI systems are deployed, and might produce truly devastating results if future systems are even more powerful and more widely used, and interact with each other and the world in presently unforeseeable ways.\n\nThis paper shares some nascent work towards one of our primary, ongoing goals, which is to align general-purpose AI systems with human preferences and values. A great deal of ink has been spilled trying to define what it means for AI systems to be aligned, and to guess at how this might go wrong. We will define an AI as \u201caligned\u201d if it is, in three words, helpful, honest, and harmless or \u2018HHH\u2019. Our alignment efforts aim to measure and address this general problem with large language models.\n\nMany researchers and organizations share this goal, but few have pursued it directly. Most research efforts associated with alignment either only pertain to very specialized systems, involve testing a specific alignment technique on a sub-problem, or are rather speculative and theoretical. Our view is that if it\u2019s possible to try to address a problem directly, then one needs a good excuse for not doing so. Historically we had such an excuse: general purpose, highly capable AIs were not available for investigation. But given the broad capabilities of large language models, we think it\u2019s time to tackle alignment directly, and that a research program focused on this goal may have the greatest chance for impact."}

Kleenex began during the First World War. It developed a crepe paper used as a filter for gas masks. In the early 1920s, it was adapted as a consumer product called Kotex brand to help women with their periods.[1] The Kotex trademark was derived from the combination of the words \"cotton\" and \"texture.\" The company itself has confirmed that this name was chosen as it \"met [their] requirements for being short, easy to say, easy to remember and easy to explain.\" In 1924, the name Kleenex was selected as the name for a line of cold cream remover, as such, the \"Kleen\" portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose. The \"ex\" was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex.[2] The first Western facial tissue was introduced in 1924 and originally marketed as a way to remove cold cream (it had already been in use in Japan for centuries; see History of facial tissue for details).[3] It was a disposable substitute for face towels or cotton wool. In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing \"the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars.\" A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the company's head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan \"Don\u2019t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket\" and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant.[4] In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.[5]"}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

Russian forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv.\n\nBiden said the United States was offering an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones and anti-armour systems.\n\n\"More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,\" he said.\n\nBiden later condemned Putin: \"He is a war criminal,\" he told reporters.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was \"unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric\", according to Tass news agency.\n\nAt the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems as the West bolsters his government, which is still holding out hope that talks with Russia can find a solution.\n\nZelenskiy said negotiations were becoming \"more realistic\" and Russia's foreign minister said proposals under discussion were \"close to an agreement.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.\n\nFootage from Ukraine's state broadcaster showed bodies lying on the street.

{"prompt": "What does this text say about the price change of Starlink?\n\nStarlink has raised its prices for equipment and monthly service, blaming inflation for the increases in an email to customers. The up-front hardware cost was raised from $499 to $599 (a 20 percent increase), and the monthly service price was raised from $99 to $110 (up 11 percent). People who preordered Starlink and paid deposits but haven't yet received it will have to pay $549 for the user terminal if they choose to keep their orders.\n\n\"Due to excessive levels of inflation, the price of the Starlink kit is increasing from $499 to $549 for deposit holders and $599 for all new orders, effective today. In addition, the Starlink monthly service price will increase from $99 to $110,\" Starlink said in an email to customers yesterday.\n\n\"Can't even honor the preorder pricing on the equipment? Brutal,\" Jon Guidry of Georgia wrote on Twitter. Guidry forwarded us the email he got from Starlink, which says, \"The sole purpose of these adjustments is to keep pace with rising inflation.\" People who preorder have to put down a deposit of $99. Those who already did that can cancel the deposit for a full refund on their account page, the email from Starlink notes.\n\nPosts in a Reddit thread indicate that the monthly increase to $110 also applies to Starlink customers who already have service.\n\n\"Since launching our public beta service in October 2020, the Starlink team has tripled the number of satellites in orbit, quadrupled the number of ground stations, and made continuous improvements to our network,\" the email from Starlink says. \"Going forward, users can expect Starlink to maintain its cadence of continuous network improvements as well as new feature additions.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this synopsis of \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 2 paragraphs or less? \n\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander's wife while singing \"Singin' in the Rain\". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer, PR Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning Alex and leaving him to be arrested. Deltoid brings word that the woman has died of her injuries, and Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is released from prison, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who is now using a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted his wife and him. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping out the window.\n\nAlex survives the attempt and wakes up in hospital with multiple injuries. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\""}

Snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches are forecast for much of the interior Northeast.\n\nModerate to heavy snow has already hit \"a rather large area\" of the eastern U.S., including as much as 8 to 12 inches in the Tennessee Valley and central Appalachia, said National Weather Service meteorologist Andrew Orrison.\n\nStrong winds were reported in southern states \u2014 gusts, possibly a tornado, hit early Saturday in Ocala, a city in central Florida, damaging buildings and homes. More than a hundred thousand power outages were reported from Pennsylvania to Florida midday Saturday, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe storm will also bring threats of flooding, hail and possible tornadoes to much of the coastal southeast, according to AccuWeather.\n\nAnd much of the northeast is also expected to see severely reduced visibility and white-out conditions, making road travel \"extremely dangerous at times,\" according to NOAA.\n\nAmid the storm, Route 581 in Pennsylvania was shut down Saturday after 73 vehicles were involved in a crash, Pennsylvania State Police said.

I just want to know what it says about him getting shot. \"Jackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals.[25] In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records.[26][27] Jackson's first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks,[18] and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album.[12] In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks;[11] eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar.[28] Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.[29][30]\n\nJackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio.[23][31] The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: \"There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant\".[23] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track,[31] and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour.[32] Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.[33]\n\nOn May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.[citation needed] Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek.[12][20][34] His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice;[20][32][35] his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard,[36] was killed three weeks later.[37]\n\nJackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'\"[20] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone\".[15] Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.[12][20][38]\n\nIn the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada.[39][40] With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\"[41] Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\""}

Yes, some fruits are high in carbohydrates and natural sugars. No, that's not a reason to avoid them.\n\nFruit supplies you with so many healthy nutrients and cancer-fighting antioxidants, they shouldn't be ignored by the carb-phobic. In fact, shunning fruit may make it harder to lose weight.\n\n\"Fresh, whole fruits help reduce belly fat and help with weight loss because they are naturally low in calories, high in volume because of the naturally occurring water in them, and are anti-inflammatory, which can help in fat loss,\" says Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, a senior dietitian at UCLA Medical Center and author of the new book Recipe for Survival.\n\n\"Inflammation increases fat deposition in the body, especially in the abdomen region, while anti-inflammatory foods, like fruits, can help burn fat in those regions.\"\n\nIf you want to get back on the fruit wagon, which fruits are the best?\n\n\"Pretty much, any fresh fruit is good for weight loss and health, because of their water content and low-calorie content,\" says Hunnes, who is also an environmentalist studying climate change. She advises avoiding dried fruit because they are calories dense, having the water dehydrated out of them. Also, nix other processed fruits that have been turned into juice or candy because they have been stripped of health benefits and are \"just concentrated sugar at that point,\" she says."}

Here is the original version of the story.\n\nSo this happened to my friend and I almost 2 decades ago but I'm only realizing the severity of it now that I remembered it.\n\nWe were like 10 (her) and 12 (me). Both girls. We snuck out in the middle of the night on a sleepover because we had a dumb urge to get some cola. And during that time the only store that was working nights was a small liquor store 30 minute walk away from where our house was. It was next to a train station, which was a sketch place overall full with drunks and the like. But us being so young we didn't know that and we just went.\n\nThe walk to the place was fine, quiet, as midnights are in a small town. But shortly after we started walking back, we noticed a car going by. The only car at that time, so we took notice. At first we didn't think much of it, but then we noticed it drove past us again. And a couple minutes later again. So we got alert and started walking faster. We were walking on the main street, which was pretty lit, so I assume now that the only reason nothing happened was because the person driving wanted to get us in a darker place. He took a turn towards a darker street once, trying to get ahead of us, but as we walked past it he drove out of it and started following us.\n\nThe moment we reached the street where we had to turn to our house, we took a sidewalk shortcut and we RAN. The shortcut didn't allow the car to drive after us straight away, and instead he had to drive slightly straight, then right, then right again into our street. And lucky the shortcut existed because at that time the street had no light. Absolutely none. But we noticed the car did actually start turning to our street and that's how we confirmed it was actually following us. Good thing the house was very closeby the time he turned to our street so he couldn't drive to us fast enough. But my God, when I think of it now I'm even more frighted than I was then because I know what could have happened since I understand it more. We could have been kidnapped, or molested, or even killed. Who knows.\n\nAt that time my friend and I forgot about the situation the very next day because we didn't realize what could have been. I wish I was smart enough back then to have remembered the plate numbers or anything. I hope that person didn't hurt anyone in that town. I now feel lucky nothing happened to us and my hometown is now in a completely different light for me since the realization."}

{"prompt": "Can you use this text to tell me 3 facts about foxes?\n\nFoxes are omnivorous mammals that are light on their feet. They are often mistaken for other members of the Canidae family, which include jackals, wolves and dogs. They stand out from their relatives because of their long, thin legs, lithe frame, pointed nose and bushy tail.\n\nThese animals are very social and live flexible lives. They are found all over the world \u2014 in North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa \u2014 and call a wide range of terrains their home. They also eat a greatly varied diet.\n\nSize\nMost foxes are around the same size as medium-sized dogs. Since foxes are smaller mammals, they are also quite light. They can weigh as little as 1.5 lbs. (680 grams) and as much as 24 lbs. (11 kg). The fennec fox is the smallest living fox and doesn't get any bigger than a cat \u2014 about 9 inches (23 centimeters) and weighing 2.2 to 3.3 lbs. (1 to 1.5 kilograms), according to National Geographic. Other species can grow to 34 inches (86 cm) from their head to their flanks. Their tails can add an additional 12 to 22 inches (30 to 56 cm) to their length. \n\nHabitat\nFoxes usually live in forested areas, though they are also found in mountains, grasslands and deserts. They make their homes by digging burrows in the ground. These burrows, also called dens, provide a cool area to sleep, a good location to store food and a safe place to have their pups. Burrows are dug-out tunnels that have rooms for the fox and its family to live in. The burrows also have several exits so that they can flee if a predator enters the burrow.\n\nHabits\nFoxes are very social creatures that live in packs. A group of foxes are called a leash, skulk or earth, according to the U.S. Department of Interior. They are also called packs. No matter what you call them, foxes like to stick near family members. A pack may include older siblings, foxes of breeding age, mates and mothers. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, and females are called vixens.\n\nThese mammals like to hunt at night and are nocturnal. This means that they sleep during the day. This can change, though, depending on where the fox pack lives. If they live in a place where they feel safe, a fox pack may hunt during the daytime, according to National Parks and Wildlife Service of Ireland.\n\nFoxes have great eyesight. They can see just as well as a cat, in fact. Their eyes are much like a cat's thanks to their vertically slit pupils.\n\nFoxes are also very fast. They can run up to 45 mph (72 km/h). That is almost as fast as the blackbuck antelope, one of the world's fastest animals.\n\nDiet\nFoxes are omnivores. This means that they eat meat and vegetation. A fox's diet can consist of small animals, such as lizards, voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. They round out their diet with birds, fruits and bugs, according to the Smithsonian. Foxes that live near the ocean eat fish and crabs, as well. If they have trouble finding food, a fox will have no problem raiding trash cans to find scraps.\n\nFoxes can eat up to several pounds of food a day. What they don't eat, they often bury under leaves or snow for later.\n\nOffspring\nFox babies are called pups. During mating season, the female will cry out to let males know that she is ready. After mating, females will make a nest of leaves inside her burrow on which to have her pups. This special room in the burrow is called a nesting chamber.\n\nThe pregnant female only carries her pups for a gestation period of 53 days. There are usually two to seven pups in a litter. Pup care is a family affair. Both the mother and father share the care of pups. Even older siblings will help take care of their younger brother and sisters by bringing them food.\n\nFoxes live very short lives in the wild. They often live only around three years, according to the Animal Diversity Web. In captivity, they can live much longer. Foxes in zoos, for example, can live 10 to 12 years."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary about what this article says about Daylight Savings Time?\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.\n\nThe Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, still must pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. The White House has not said whether Biden supports it.\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said after input from airlines and broadcasters that supporters agreed that the change would not take place until November 2023.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America but it is one of those issues that there is a lot of agreement. ... If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore,\" Rubio added. \"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nAbout 30 states since 2015 have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue this month. Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said that \"the loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found that 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nSupporters argue it could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\nThe use of daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was adopted in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time."}

{"prompt": "After Evan Seyfried died last year, his family filed a lawsuit against his employer, Kroger, saying he was driven to suicide by harassment from his managers.\n\nWednesday marks the anniversary of his death. The group \"Justice for Evan\" has planned in-person protests in 15 cities, including Cincinnati, and online events in three more.\n\nJana Murphy leads the group and said Seyfried's death put a spotlight on workplace harassment and \"organization mobbing.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reported in 2019 that more than 90% of employees say they've been bullied at work.\n\nSince Seyfried's death, Murphy said hundreds of people have come forward with similar stories of their workplaces.\n\n\"He was bullied by his manager. He was mobbed by Kroger,\" Murphy said. \"His death was 100% preventable.\"\n\nShe said Seyfried was a whistleblower and followed all the proper corporate channels to report the abuse he was experiencing, but Kroger did not protect him. These accusations are reflected with the wrongful death lawsuit still pending before the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.\n\nMurphy said Seyfried was a good person.\n\n\"Bullies don't like good people,\" said said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Seyfried was ridiculed for wearing a mask in the early days of the pandemic, was taunted for his political views, was given the nickname \"Antifa,\" was stalked outside his home, was sexually harassed and sent child pornography via text message.\n\nSeyfried was expecting to be fired but was also worried his managers and their allies would frame him for a crime like stealing from the store or possessing the child pornography they had sent him, the lawsuit states.\n\nAfter 19 years with Kroger and months of harassment, the lawsuit states Seyfried had a \"transient episodic break\" throwing away his possessions and wandering the streets of Cincinnati for several hours before his parents found him.\n\nThat night, Seyfried, who had no prior history of mental illness, according to his lawyers, agreed to go to the hospital in the morning for help. But he never got there.\n\n\"Around midnight, Evan told his father that [his managers] were going to 'get him' and that 'things would get ugly,'\" the lawsuit states. \"These were the last words Evan spoke to his father before he killed himself.\"\n\nMurphy said her group is demanding Kroger acknowledge responsibility for Evan\u2019s death and hold his abusers accountable.\nCan you summarize this article into 2 bullet points for me?"}

{"prompt": "What does this text say that hyenas eat?\n\nThese interesting carnivores live in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. They are able to survive in savannas and swamps, as well as semi-arid regions, and even mountainous forest areas. Rather than resting in dens, adult spotted hyenas sleep in holes or shallow pools or under bushes or scrubs\u2014anywhere they can find shade during the heat of the day. Hyenas use watering holes as places to cool off or to hide extra food. Spotted hyenas can be active both day and night, depending on their needs and whether there are humans around, but they are generally nocturnal.\n\nLions and hyenas compete over the same food in overlapping territories. Sometimes the hyenas do the work of organizing, chasing down, and killing prey only to have lions steal it. Lions often injure or kill hyenas as they fight over a carcass. Both hyenas and lions mark and establish territories, and both species are always on guard. When confronted by a lion, the spotted hyena calls for help from other hyenas.\n\nIn a large group, spotted hyenas are able to chase lions away from a kill. But during a hunt, the hyena's impressive hunting skills come into play. They are able to chase down prey over long distances while running at up to 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour). \n\nSpotted hyenas often pick out the young or weak from the herd, but they can kill even healthy adult ungulates. What they hunt depends on numbers. The bigger the hyena clan, the larger its prey. This can include young rhinos, adult wildebeest, zebras, and Cape buffalo. The hyenas work in a group when hunting such large prey, and young hyenas take years to become successful. Smaller packs chase down gazelles, impalas, warthogs, and waterbucks.\n\nWhen hunting alone, a spotted hyena may go after smaller prey. Ground birds, rabbits, springhare, bat-eared foxes, porcupines, jackals, and fish can be on the menu. Even ostrich eggs are fair game! Spotted hyenas also scavenge, but they have to compete with jackals and vultures for these leftovers.\n\nA hyena can eat quite a bit at one time. Sometimes, leftovers are buried in a mud hole for a later meal. Spotted hyenas give new meaning to the phrase \"lick the platter clean.\" They eat practically every part of their prey, including skin, hooves, bone, and teeth. Powerful jaws are able to crush bones with ease. Most other predators couldn\u2019t eat those things, even if they tried. There are some items that hyenas can\u2019t digest, such as hair and horns, although they still eat them."}

{"prompt": "A 13-year-old was driving the pickup truck that struck a van in West Texas in a fiery collision that killed nine people, including six members of a college golf team and their coach, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Thursday.\n\nThe child and a man traveling in the truck also died.\n\nThe truck\u2019s left front tire, which was a spare tire, also blew out before impact, said NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg.\n\nAlthough it was unclear how fast the two vehicles were traveling, \u201cthis was clearly a high-speed collision,\u201d Landsberg said. He added investigators hoped to retrieve enough information from the vehicle\u2019s recorders to better understand what happened.\n\nOne must be 14 in Texas to start taking classroom courses for a learner\u2019s license and 15 to receive that provisional license to drive with an instructor or licensed adult in the vehicle. Department of Public Safety Sgt. Victor Taylor said a 13-year-old driving would be breaking the law.\n\nThe pickup truck crossed into the opposite lane on a darkened, two-lane highway before colliding head-on with a van, killing the boy, a man traveling with him, six New Mexico college students and a golf coach.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for people in rural parts of the U.S. to learn to drive when they\u2019re young. But the news that a 13-year-old was behind the wheel in the Texas crash put a renewed focus on the practice.\n\nThe University of the Southwest students, including one from Portugal and one from Mexico, and the coach were returning from a golf tournament when the vehicles collided Tuesday night. Two Canadian students were hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nThe NTSB sent an investigative team to the crash site in Texas\u2019 Andrews County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of the New Mexico state line. While the area is rural, its roads can often be busy with traffic related to agriculture and oil and gas development.\n\nUniversity of the Southwest spokeswoman Maria Duarte declined to comment on the NTSB\u2019s announcement about the young driver, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe golf teams were traveling in a 2017 Ford Transit van that was towing a box trailer when it collided with the truck, and both vehicles burst into flames, according to NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss.\n\nHe said the vehicles crashed on a two-lane asphalt highway where the speed limit is 75 mph (120 kph), though investigators have not yet determined how fast either vehicle was traveling.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety identified the deceased as: Golf coach Tyler James, 26, of Hobbs, New Mexico; and players Mauricio Sanchez, 19, of Mexico; Travis Garcia, 19, of Pleasanton, Texas; Jackson Zinn, 22, of Westminster, Colorado; Karisa Raines, 21, of Fort Stockton, Texas; Laci Stone, 18, of Nocona, Texas; and Tiago Sousa, 18, of Portugal.\n\nAlso killed were Henrich Siemens, 38, of Seminole County, Texas, and the unidentified 13-year-old boy who were in the 2007 Dodge 2500 pickup.\n\nCritically injured aboard the van were Canadian students Dayton Price, 19, of Mississauga, Ontario, and Hayden Underhill, 20, of Amherstview, Ontario. Both were taken by helicopter to the University Medical Center in Lubbock, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the northeast.\n\n\u201cThey are both stable and recovering and every day making more and more progress,\u201d University of the Southwest Provost Ryan Tipton said Thursday of the two injured students.\n\n\u201cOne of the students is eating chicken soup,\u201d said Tipton, calling their recovery \u201ca game of inches.\u201d\n\nTipton said University President Quint Thurman visited the students\u2019 parents at the hospital, illustrating the close community at the college with only about 350 on-campus students.\n\nUnderhill\u2019s brother Drew said their parents, Ken and Wendy, flew to Texas.\n\n\u201cHockey was a big part of life for a while, but his true passion is golf,\u201d Drew Underhill said.\n\nOn Thursday evening, about 150 people turned out to remember Zinn at Texas Roadhouse, a Hobbs restaurant where he worked and met his girlfriend of five months.\n\n\u201cWe met here exactly at this table,\u201d said Maddy Russell, 20, of Hobbs. \u201cHe was my heart.\u201d\n\nThe mourners released around 100 blue and orange balloons into the cold, whipping wind of eastern New Mexico, and they soon disappeared into the horizon.\n\nThe Mexican Federation of Golf posted an online note of condolence to the loved ones of Sanchez.\n\nSousa was from Portugal's southern coast, where he graduated from high school last summer before heading to college in the U.S., said Renata Afonso, head of the Escola Secund\u00e1ria de Loul\u00e9.\n\n\"Any school would be delighted to have had him as a student,\u201d she said.\n\nTeam member Jasmin Collum had been scheduled to play but at the last minute decided instead to visit her parents in Houston, her mother said.\n\n\u201cWe knew all those people on board,\u201d Tonya Collum said. \"Basically the whole team is gone or in the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe University of the Southwest is a private, Christian college in Hobbs, New Mexico, near the state line with Texas.\nCan you summarize this into 2 bullet points for me please?"}

Dallas is currently only one point back of Nashville and Vegas with games on hand against both. The loss of Miro Heiskanen earlier this week is something to keep an eye on given how close the wild card race is right now but don\u2019t be surprised if Dallas finds their way into the playoffs this year.\n\nVancouver is also only trailing a wild card berth by three points. They had a very rough start to the season but the mid-season hiring of Bruce Boudreau has given them a serious jolt and turned things around for them entirely. Given Calgary\u2019s success in the playoffs against Vancouver historically, rooting for this matchup would be even more ideal for the Flames.\n\nWinnipeg is also not far behind, only out of the playoffs by four points. Winnipeg has had their struggles this season and Hellebuyck isn\u2019t having his best year, but it isn\u2019t totally over for the Jets quite yet.\n\nFinally Anaheim isn\u2019t totally out of it either. They had a very strong start and surprising start to their season but have since fallen off and are now five points out of a wild card spot."}

Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the album was written largely by Swift while she was promoting her 2006 self-titled debut album in 2007 and 2008. Fearless is a country pop record featuring traditional country instruments such as banjos. The lyrics explore themes of teenage romance, heartache, and aspirations. The album's title refers to the overarching theme of all of its tracks, which depict Swift gaining courage to embrace love's challenges. After the release of Fearless, Swift embarked on the Fearless Tour, which ran from April 2009 to July 2010. Two singles from the album, \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", were successful on both country and pop radio. The album spent eleven weeks atop the US Billboard 200 and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America."}

He accepts, everything goes well, he sleeps at my place and the next day we leave with friends for 2 hours of road (for the forest it is a bit far but at the time I lived in the city center)\n\nAfter the road I realize that I forgot the keys to my house at home and that therefore the door to my house was not locked, but hey I tell myself that we are in town and that few people frequent the suburbs to fly. The day is going well and it's time to go home, I was stressed about knowing if my house had been robbed. Then in the end I said to myself that there was little chance.\n\nMy friend Jacob wanted to spend more time with me before I left for my studies and so did he, so I accepted that he still sleeps with me. We walk in and I see that my house is intact but it was nice and wide open, so I walked around the house and noticed something. The cellar door (which I never open) was open and there was white paper on the floor. I quickly realized that we had to call the police and check if there was anyone there so to reassure us, me and Jacob decided to shout that if the stranger didn't come out, the police would take care of it.\n\nI was paralyzed with fear and I feared that the stranger was coming, bad news, the stranger who was in the cellar cried \"you are not at home, get out of where I lock you up\" Jacob got scared and asked me to come and see if there was the police, luckily she was there and took him away in a car, the police found kitchen knives, an axe, iron chains and a board, there was also a white sheet on which was written \"behind you\". I didn't understand from the beginning, the police told me later that the individual ran away from an asylum, today I am 25 and now I always check if I have the key on me or not."}

{"prompt": "Can you explain this text to me in 3 sentences?\n\nCertain animals hibernate because food supplies become scarce during the winter months. By going into a long deep sleep, they bypass this period completely, waking up when food becomes more plentiful.\n\nBears are most commonly associated with hibernation (although they are not considered true hibernators, because their body temperature doesn\u2019t lower significantly), but a variety of animals take advantage of this evolved adaptation, including the jumping mouse, little brown bat, eastern chipmunk, woodchuck, and certain species of ground squirrels. At least one bird is known to be a hibernator\u2014the poorwill, which lives in western North America.\n\nIt is believed that a compound in the blood of hibernators known as HIT (Hibernation Induction Trigger) lets animals know when it\u2019s time to prepare for hibernation. Shorter days, diminishing food supplies, and colder temperatures all appear to influence HIT, though the exact mechanism remains a mystery.\n\nHibernators tend to eat a lot of extra food in the fall in anticipation of their winter slumber and build significant stores of white and brown body fat to tide them over. Brown fat provides extra body heat as well as needed energy when the animal wakes up. Some animals also store food in their dens to consume during brief periods of wakefulness.\n\nHibernation is nothing like a regular night\u2019s sleep. In fact, significant physical changes occur within the body during the hibernation period. An animal\u2019s body temperature plunges, and its respiration and heart rate slow dramatically. The effect can be so extreme that a hibernating animal may appear dead.\n\nSeveral factors can influence hibernation. In regions where the winter is relatively mild, animals may hibernate for only brief periods or not at all. During periods of long hibernation, many animals will rouse briefly to go to the bathroom and eat a snack before falling asleep again. Certain species of bears are unique in that they do not awaken, eat, drink, or go to the bathroom during their hibernation period, which can last several months."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this article on sleep talking in bullet point format?\n\nBy definition, sleep talking is a disorder that sufferers don\u2019t know they have. When they find out, fear quickly follows: Did I say something embarrassing? Reveal my inner desires? My deepest, darkest secret? New research from the Sorbonne reveals that our sleep speech isn\u2019t usually that saucy. But it can reveal clues into our dreams \u2013 and unravel mysteries about the sleeping brain.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, Dr. Isabelle Arnulf and her team at the European Sleep Research Laboratories found that we follow the same speech patterns while we sleep as we do when we\u2019re awake. We use proper syntax, mind our grammar, and pause for imaginary respondents to participate in the conversation. We are, however, three times more negative and 800 times more likely to curse as we slumber.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t disclose personal secrets, but you may allude to things or people you encountered during the day. According to Dr. Deirdre Barrett, Harvard professor and \u201cThe Committee of Sleep\u201d author, sleep talking is usually provocative. But it\u2019s mostly fanciful, fictional material, so we shouldn\u2019t take sleep talking too seriously. Dr. Arnulf told us that it\u2019s often difficult to understand sleep speech anyway: \u201cThe mean number of understandable words uttered per night is 15 in women and 22 in men.\u201d\n\nIt varies by subject, but sleep speech tends to be \u201cnegative, interrogative, and brief.\u201d Several researchers have found that sleep talk is mostly heated conversations with an unidentified \u201cyou.\u201d Nearly 10 percent of the sleep talk in Dr. Arnulf\u2019s study contained profanities, and \u201cno\u201d was the most frequently spoken term. Men were both more likely to talk in their sleep and more likely to curse.\n\nDr. Arnulf\u2019s team has come up with multiple possible reasons we\u2019re so aggressive as we snooze. She hypothesizes that it\u2019s probably because sleep talk is related to our dreams, which tend to be more negative than positive. According to Arnulf, it could also be that some parts of our frontal lobe aren\u2019t connected during sleep or that sleep talk only represents the last, but most emotive part of a longer dream sequence.\n\nSleep talking has long been linked to anxiety. Dr. Nerina Ramlakhan, sleep therapist and author of \u201cFast Asleep Wide Awake,\u201d told us that we talk in our sleep to express unresolved conflict and stress. She says that those who keep their feelings bottled up during the day are more likely to spill in their sleep. She\u2019s also found that stimulants like technology, caffeine, and alcohol activate our nervous system and lead to greater incidences of sleep talking. Eating well, reducing exposure to such stimulants, and keeping a journal can help you kick the habit. Getting enough sleep is also key, as sleep deprived individuals tend to sleep talk more.\n\nThere are, however, natural predispositions for sleep talking as well. Dr. Barrett told us that sleep talking is more common in children, with between 22-60 percent of the young population speaking in their sleep at least occasionally. In the Sorbonne study, Dr. Arnulf found that people who talked in their sleep as children were more likely to talk in their sleep as adults.\n\nSleep talking may also be hereditary, as you\u2019re more likely to talk in your sleep if you come from a family of sleep talkers. Dr. Barrett pointed us to a Finnish study of twins, which highlighted heritability for both sleepwalking and sleep talking. It turns out you\u2019re also more likely to talk in your sleep if you walk in your sleep.\n\nSleep talking is usually rare and short-lived. Most cases are innocent and don\u2019t require treatment. Sleep talking is actually a bigger problem to partners than the talkers themselves. Dr. Barrett suggests that those with sleep talking partners invest in earplugs or move to a separate bed.\n\nHowever, if you start sleep talking after a traumatic experience, you may want to consult a professional. And if you\u2019re suffering from excessive daytime fatigue on top of sleep talking, it could indicate something more serious. As a rule of thumb, you should seek a specialist\u2019s help if you\u2019re sleep talking several nights a month or if you\u2019re exhibiting other disruptive sleep behaviors, like shouting or kicking, too.\n\nProfessor Arnulf\u2019s study found that the sleeping brain uses the same networks as the waking one, indicating that sleep is not the \u201cpassive, isolated state\u201d people once believed it to be. In fact, our brains function at an extremely high level as we sleep, activating both the frontal and temporal lobes. Perhaps most impressive, our sleeping brains seem able to hallucinate conversations in real time.\n\nThis research is widely believed to be the largest sleep talking study ever conducted. Arnulf believes the difficulty of capturing sleep-talking data could be why more scientists aren\u2019t going further. Her team recorded more than 15,000 sleeping people over five years to gather just 232 recordings of coherent sleep talk. She encourages her peers to continue pushing the subject though. Sleep talking studies offer a foundation for solving some of the remaining mysteries about sleep.\n\nPlus, it can be fun. Dr. Barrett\u2019s research has shown that a sleep talker can arouse their bed partner into conversation, creating whacky dialogues. In one recording, someone said, \u201cYou\u2019re talking in your sleep,\u201d and the other responded, \u201cNo, you\u2019re talking in your sleep!\u201d In truth, they both were. Very meta \u2014 and entertaining.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to hear what you say in bed, try downloading a sleep talk recorder app. You just may discover what you\u2019ve been dreaming about. At the very least, you\u2019ll get a funny story."}

{"prompt": "Alabama residents will no longer be required to hold a permit to conceal and carry a handgun in the state after Gov. Kay Ivey (R) on Thursday signed a bill effectuating the change into law.\n\nThe bill, which was passed along party lines with major Republican support and Democrat opposition, takes effect in January of next year, according to a press release from the governor's office.\n\nIvey said she was defending Second Amendment rights in her state.\n\n\"Unlike most states who are doing everything in their power to make it harder for law abiding citizens, Alabama is reaffirming our commitment to defending our Second Amendment rights,\" the governor said in a statement. \"I have always stood up for the rights of law abiding gunowners, and I am proud to do that again.\"\n\nAlabama becomes the 22nd state to not require a permit to conceal and carry a firearm, according to the Pew Research Organization. Last year, six states - Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah - passed bills bypassing the permit process for some firearms.\n\nAlso this week, Georgia's state House and Senate passed a similar bill not requiring a permit to conceal and carry a handgun, a measure expected to eventually be signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp (R).\n\nIn Alabama, the new law eliminates \"the requirement for a person to obtain a concealed carry permit to lawfully carry a pistol,\" according to a text of the passed bill.\n\nSome police spoke out against the bill, including the Alabama Sheriff's Association.\n\nEdward Delmore, a police chief in the community of Gulf Shore, said \"this bill doesn't comply with common sense,\" during a protest against the measure earlier this year, according to the Alabama News Network.\n\n\"No one up here is anti-Second Amendment,\" he said. \"Some have said that, it can't be further from the truth.\"\n\nBut the measure won support from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which said in a Thursday tweet that \"Alabamians are safer for it.\"\n\nIt also had the backing of some GOP former law enforcement officials in the state congress, AL.com reported.

Possibly one of the best popular music documentaries of our time. \"Get Back\" chronicles the January 1969 Beatles \"Let It Be\" project from start to finish, including the creativity, fun, crisis, and uncertainty about what the project was actually going to be about. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings/Hobbit) does a remarkable job taking us on this often bumpy journey. His 6-hour rockumentary shows The Beatles emerging triumphant by the end - giving a free concert for the whole of the London Business District from the rooftop of their Apple building at 3 Saville Row. The main takeaway is - these four guys genuinely loved and respected each other. Their interpersonal relationships, when seen through Jackon's lens, are far more positive than the previous negativity put forth in the heavily-edited Let It Be film (United Artists 1970). \"Get Back\" is highly recommended for any Beatles fan...or anyone who wants to take an in-depth journey back to the late 1960's and get a rare glimpse at their creative process.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article using bullet points?\n\nIn the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nThe article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to \"refute\" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.\nThe sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.\n\nThe authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.\n\n\"It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,\" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.\nIn the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.The researchers note that they worked under some limitations \u2014 \"We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,\" they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.\n\nThere's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is \"circumstantial\" evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.\n\nFor one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.\n\nIf Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet \u2014 for the sake of their health \u2014 they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third.\nBut in the '60s, the SRF became aware of \"flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,\" as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.\n\nHe recommended that the industry fund its own studies \u2014 \"Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.\"\n\nThe next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.\nOne of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department \u2014 and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.\nGlantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiquedIn a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's \"particular interest\" was in evaluating studies focused on \"carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.\"\n\n\"We are well aware,\" one of the scientists replied, \"and will cover this as well as we can.\"\n\nThe project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.Hickson was certainly happy with the result: \"Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,\" he told one of the scientists.\n\nThe review minimized the significance of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.\n\n\"It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,\" Kearns told Bloomberg via email. But, she says, \"the authors applied a different standard\" to different studies \u2014 looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.\n\nEpidemiological studies of sugar consumption \u2014 which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world \u2014 were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.\n\nOne study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.\n\nAnother study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because \"such diets are rarely consumed by man.\"\n\nThe Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat \u2014 which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.\n\nCiting \"few study characteristics and no quantitative results,\" as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was \"no doubt\" the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.\n\nSugar lobby: \"Transparency standards were not the norm\"\n\nIn a statement, the Sugar Association \u2014 which evolved out of the SRF \u2014 said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.\n\n\"We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,\" the association said.\n\n\"Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,\" the statement continues. \"What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.\"\n\nThe documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle notes in a commentary in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine:\n\n\"Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails revealing Coca-Cola's cozy relationships with sponsored researchers who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity. Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a candy trade association funded and influenced studies to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not.\"\n\nAs for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.\n\n\"Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,\" they write.\nThey also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me?\n\nA new analysis of Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains reveals physical differences in the femur, other bones, and dental structures across specimens that could suggest Tyrannosaurus rex specimens need to be re-categorized into three distinct groups or species, reports a study published in Evolutionary Biology.\n\nTyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs, or genus, Tyrannosaurus to date. Previous research has acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains in the femur (thighbone) and specimens with either one or two slender incisor teeth on each side of front ends of the jaw.\n\nGregory Paul and colleagues analyzed the bones and dental remains of 37 Tyrannosaurus specimens. The authors compared the robustness of the femur in 24 of the specimens, a measure calculated from the length and circumference that gives an indication of the strength of the bone. They also measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender incisiform teeth.\n\nThe authors observed that the femur varied across specimens, some with more robust femurs and others with more gracile femurs. The authors found there were two times more robust femurs than gracile ones across specimens, which suggests that this is not a difference caused by sex, which would likely result in a more even split. The authors also suggest that the variation in femurs is not related to growth of the specimen as robust femurs were found in some juvenile specimens two thirds the size of an adult and gracile femurs were found in some specimens that were full adult size.\n\nDental structure also varied across specimens, although those with both femur measurements and dental remains was low (12 specimens). Specimens with one incisor tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.\n\nOf the Tyrannosaurus specimens, 28 could be identified in distinct layers of sediment (stratigraphy) at the Lancian upper Masstrichtian formations in North America (estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago). The authors compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.\n\nOnly robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment (six femurs). The variation of femur robustness in the lower layer was not different to that of other theropod species, which indicates that likely only one species of Tyrannosaurus existed at this point. Only one gracile Tyrannosaurus femur was identified in the middle layer with five other gracile femurs in the upper layer, alongside other robust femurs. The variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher than what was observed in some earlier theropod specimens. This suggests that the Tyrannosaurus specimens found at higher layers of sediment physically developed into more distinct forms compared to specimens from lower layers, and other dinosaur species.\n\nGregory Paul, lead author, said: \u201cWe found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen. We propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.\u201d\n\nThe authors nominate two potential new species of Tyrannosaurus based on their analysis. The first, Tyrannosaurus imperator (tyrant lizard emperor), relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, characterized with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth. The authors argue these features have been retained from earlier ancestors (tyrannosaurids). The second, Tyrannosaurus regina (tyrant lizard queen), is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, characterized with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The recognized species Tyrannosaurus rex (tyrant lizard king) was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment with specimens classed as retaining more robust femurs while having only one incisor tooth. Some specimens could not be identified based on their remains so were not assigned to a species.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that they cannot rule out that the observed variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups, and they also caution that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. The authors discuss the difficulties of assigning fossil vertebrates to a potential new species.\n\nThe authors conclude that the physical variation found in Tyrannosaurus specimens combined with their stratigraphy are indicative of three potential groups that could be nominated as two new species, T. imperator and T. regina, alongside the only recognized species to date, T. rex."}

The butterfly effect is a term coined by Edward Lorenz, an American mathematician, meteorologist, and a pioneer of chaos theory (and who does NOT look like Jeff Goldblum) that essentially says that a hurricane can be influenced by the distant flapping of butterfly wings several weeks earlier. Although his research took place in the 50s, his description of the idea took place in the later 60s.\n\nRay Bradbury\u2019s short story A Sound of Thunder, first published in Collier's magazine in the June 28, 1952 issue and Playboy in June 1956 deals with, and actually includes, a butterfly and most definitely explains the idea in a fantastic way better adapted to lay explanation than the good physics professor Lorenz.\n\nTime Safari Inc., for a sizeable fee, will take a client back in time, WAY back, so that they can hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But overly conscious of any possible effect on future time (the butterfly effect) great measures are taken to ensure that as little impact on time is allowed. Time Safari employees mark possible huntee animals as those who would have died anyway and a gravity defying path is formed to protect every blade of ancient grass.\n\nBut what happens when a hunter walks off the path?\n\nBradbury demonstrates AGAIN that he is the literary equivalent to Chuck Norris, kicking ass, taking names, and teaching physics without a chalkboard to generations of SF/F readers."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 important facts from the information below?\n\nPolar bears are stocky, with a long neck, relatively small head, short, rounded ears, and a short tail. The male, which is much larger than the female, weighs 410 to 720 kg (900 to 1,600 pounds). It grows to about 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) tall at the shoulder and 2.2\u20132.5 metres in length. The tail is 7\u201312 cm (3\u20135 inches) long. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear\u2019s black skin. Under the skin is a layer of insulating fat. The broad feet have hairy soles to protect and insulate as well as to facilitate movement across ice, as does the uneven skin on the soles of the feet, which helps to prevent slipping. Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey.\n\nPolar bears are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds. The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born. Polar bears prefer ice that is subject to periodic fracturing by wind and sea currents, because these fractures offer seals access to both air and water. As their prey is aquatic, polar bears are excellent swimmers, and they are even known to kill beluga whales. In swimming, the polar bear uses only its front limbs, an aquatic adaptation found in no other four-legged mammal. Polar bears are opportunistic as well as predatory: they will consume dead fish and carcasses of stranded whales and eat garbage near human settlements.\n\nMating occurs in spring, and implantation of the fertilized ovum is delayed. Including the delay, gestation may last 195\u2013265 days, and one to four cubs, usually two, are born during the winter in a den of ice or snow. Cubs weigh less than 1 kg at birth and are not weaned until after they are two years old. Young polar bears may die of starvation or may be killed by adult males, and for this reason female polar bears are extremely defensive of their young when adult males are present. Young remain with their mothers until they reach sexual maturity. Females first reproduce at four to eight years of age and breed every two to four years thereafter. Males mature at about the same age as females but do not breed until a few years later. Adult polar bears have no natural predators, though walruses and wolves can kill them. Longevity in the wild is 25 to 30 years, but in captivity several polar bears have lived to more than 35 years old."}

Cool the burn. Immediately immerse the burn in cool tap water or apply cold, wet compresses. Do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides.\n\n2. Apply petroleum jelly two to three times daily. Do not apply ointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn, as these may cause an infection. Do not apply topical antibiotics.\n\n3. Cover the burn with a nonstick, sterile bandage. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered. Do not pop the blisters.\n\n4. Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation.\n\n5. Protect the area from the sun. Once the burn heals, protect the area from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. This will help minimize scarring, as the redness from a burn sometimes persists for weeks, especially in those with darker skin tones."}

{"prompt": "Can you present me with the basic points talked about in this article?\n\n\"The internet is dead, according to the internet. It\u2019s a contradictory statement, I know. How could an entity that is alive claim that it is deceased? \n\nBut a growing number of online communities believe the internet \u201cdied\u201d sometime between 2016 and 2017 and has since been taken over by bots that are spreading seemingly lifeless content that Big Tech and the government created in attempts to manipulate culture en masse. \n\n If this is starting to seem like a conspiracy theory, you are correct. \n\nThis alleged phenomenon has been dubbed the Dead Internet Theory. I first read about it in an article from The Atlantic titled \u201cMaybe You Missed It, but the Internet \u2018Died\u2019 Five Years Ago,\u201d which offers a deep dive into this strange, outlandish ideology filled with deepfakes, artificial intelligence and government psyops. \n\nI am a sucker for a good conspiracy theory. Mainly, I am fascinated by how such stories originate and what they tell us about our broader culture. Just as The Atlantic writer Kaitlyn Tiffany poses, the Dead Internet Theory \u201c[is] ridiculous, but possibly not that ridiculous?\u201d Discard all the farcical details, and we wonder: could there be a glimmer of truth? I went down a rabbit hole of Reddit forums and YouTube videos to see for myself. \n\nOn a conspiracy Reddit forum, users try to legitimize \u2014 or delegitimize \u2014 the Dead Internet Theory. Some ardent believers, like user UMSHINI-WEQANDA-4K, claim that \u201cthis is a theory in the way gravity is a theory.\u201d Others, such as user Chitauri2, state the theory should be loosely viewed. The internet hasn\u2019t died per se, but they suggest the structure and content have dramatically changed since the early aughts. \n\nChitauri2 notes how content used to be primarily generated by people. Now, AI has advanced enough that bots are not only disseminating content, but they are generating it, which according to them, is causing homogenization. I could see this point. \n\nTheoretically, a person or company could deploy bots to artificially create and amplify a post. Through algorithms on Facebook or Twitter, the same message will be viewed ad nauseam. This, of course, is a great way to sell a product, promote a personal brand or launch a campaign. But it\u2019s a double-edged sword when self-interest or political agendas completely take over.  \n\n\u201cYes, the internet might seem gigantic, but it\u2019s like a hot air balloon with nothing inside,\u201d states YouTuber Comrade Slav, who advocates a more extreme view on the Dead Internet Theory.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into three sentences: Overthinking is an anxious tendency that I encounter often in my psychotherapy practice. There are many ways we tend to overthink, such as rehashing the past \u2014 replaying the same scenario over and over in our head. Worrying is another form, in which we obsess over what the future might bring.\n\nI can empathize. When I was younger, overthinking decreased my quality of life. Research has shown that overthinking can decrease energy, limit creativity and cause sleeping problems.\n\nEventually, I knew I needed a healthy way to cope, and I created a career out of helping other people do the same. Here are three strategies I use every day to stop overthinking:\n1. Positive reframing\n\nThis is often confused with \u201ctoxic positivity,\u201d which asks people to think positively \u2014 no matter how difficult a situation is.\n\nPositive reframing, on the other hand, allows you to acknowledge the negative aspects, then asks you to evaluate whether there\u2019s another way to think about the situation. Perhaps there are benefits or things you can change about it.\n\nExample:\n\nYou constantly find yourself complaining: \u201cI hate being a boss. On top of all these deadlines and responsibilities, it\u2019s hard to manage so many complex personalities. It\u2019s emotionally and mentally exhausting. My job just sucks.\u201d\n\nVenting might feel good for a second, but it doesn\u2019t solve anything. And you\u2019ll likely continue to dwell on how much you hate your job or how bad you think you are at managing.\n\nTo practice positive reframing, replace the thought above with: \u201cThings are challenging right now and I\u2019m feeling disconnected from some things on my plate. I wonder if I can change anything about this situation or my expectations about it.\u201d\n\nThis thought pattern gives you the power to change your situation. You could start small by examining what important tasks needs to get done first, then either delay or delegate the rest until you are feeling less anxious. The key is to take a step back and deal with things one at a time.\n2. Write down your thoughts once, then distract yourself for 24 hours\n\nWhen our brains think we are in conflict or danger, a built-in alarm system goes off internally to protect us.\n\nOne thing I have found success with is writing down my feelings and waiting at least 24 hours (or just a few hours if it\u2019s an urgent matter) before replying or taking any sort of impulsive action.\n\nThen, I put that draft away while I distract myself with another task.\n\nExample:\n\nYou just received an email about something that went awry. You are upset, your heart starts to race, your breathing gets shallow, and you become hyper-focused on what\u2019s going wrong and why it\u2019s your fault.\n\nIf you respond to the email while your brain is in \u201calarm mode,\u201d you might say things you\u2019ll regret later on, which may then fuel the vicious cycle of overthinking.\n\nWriting negative thoughts down takes the power out of them; I often don\u2019t feel the need to take action based on my anxious thoughts once I\u2019ve written them down. \n3. Practice \u2018specific gratitude\u2019\n\nIn psychology, we know that expressing gratitude can increase our happiness. It can help us contextualize our frustrations against what we love and help us connect to something larger than ourselves \u2014 whether that\u2019s other people, animals, nature or a higher power.\n\nBut I find that repeating the same gratitude practice over and over again can become rote and diminish the returns. For me, it can start to feel like a meaningless chore instead of a mindful practice. So, I like to practice something that I call \u201cspecific gratitude.\u201d\n\nExample:\n\nInstead of writing in my journal every day that \u201cI am grateful for my health,\u201d I\u2019ll write something like, \u201cI am grateful that I woke up today without any back pain and have the ability to do today\u2019s workout.\u201d\n\nThis helps me stay focused on the here and now, rather than overthinking on general abstractions. Tomorrow, I might still be grateful for my health, but I might specifically be grateful that I have enough energy for a long run."}
{"prompt": "I don't quite understand this article. Is the author saying that because some people have underlying illnesses, mask mandates should stay in place? \"Tasha Nelson\u2019s 10-year-old son held back tears when he heard the news. The two were in the car when the announcement came through the radio: Virginia\u2019s freshly sworn-in governor had signed an order attempting to ban mask mandates in schools.\n\n\u201cMy son looked up at me and he had tears in his eyes because he knew what it meant. He said, \u2018Mom, does that mean I can\u2019t go to school anymore?\u2019\u201d Nelson said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Can\u2019t we let the governor know about kids like me? I want to go to school too.\u2019\u201d\n\nJack, a fourth grader, has cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic disease that causes persistent, damaging lung infections, making it harder to breathe over time. Like other immunocompromised, disabled and chronically ill Americans, Jack was taking measures, like masking, to dodge infections before the pandemic too. But with Covid-19 still rampant, it\u2019s not as easy. Even though he\u2019s vaccinated, the virus poses a serious, potentially deadly, risk to Jack. His 2-year-old brother, who is not yet eligible for the shots, is another concern. Nelson is among a group of parents who sued Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin over that order, claiming it puts students who are immunocompromised or have disabilities at risk and violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. CNN has reached out to Youngkin\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nRoughly two weeks after that lawsuit was filed, the governor signed a bill into law allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates.\n\nNelson is keeping her son at home again because of it. \u201cThis whole pandemic, our culture, media (and) government has made it very clear to high-risk and disabled people that we are an acceptable loss,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to survive this pandemic too.\u201d The couple considered leaving their home in Ames and moving to southern California, where stricter masking protocols could have helped protect her. But they ruled out the idea after California\u2019s governor lifted the indoor mask mandate for vaccinated people this month, citing a drop in infections.\n\nIowa\u2019s lawmakers are going even further \u2013 a bill looking to effectively ban vaccine and mask mandates is making its way through the legislature. \u201cWe have to make a choice between staying alive and having a life,\u201d Willette said.\n\nThe high-risk people CNN spoke to said as the country eagerly looks to move on from the pandemic, they feel forgotten \u2013 and worse, like they don\u2019t matter to the rest of the American public. Some say they feel like they\u2019ve been left to adapt to a more dangerous reality, while others are now mapping out a permanently isolated lifestyle.\"\n\nCovid-19 cases and hospitalizations are declining nationwide, but transmission \u2013 how much virus is circulating in a community \u2013 remains high in more than 90% of the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC still recommends everyone to mask indoors in areas of substantial or high transmission.\n\nBut public health experts are split on whether it\u2019s time to lift mitigation measures. Some say dropping protections at a time when Covid-19 numbers are so high is a political move rather than a public health one. Others say the downward trends justify those moves and note Omicron is milder than earlier variants for most healthy people. As local and state leaders nationwide remove mask and vaccination rules, those at high risk for severe disease say doing away with protections now leaves them more vulnerable, especially as they, or family members, return to in-person work or school. And for some, Covid-19 vaccines are not as effective in staving off a severe bout with the virus, prompting the CDC to recommend a fourth shot for immunocompromised people 12 years and older in October.\n\nRoughly seven million American adults are immunocompromised, the CDC estimates. While not all have conditions that leave them severely immunocompromised and vulnerable to severe Covid-19, about 61 million adults \u2013 roughly one in four in the US \u2013 have some type of disability, according to the agency. More than three million children had a disability in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau. \u201cEveryone knows someone who had cancer, everyone knows somebody who had a kidney transplant for one reason or another, or someone who\u2019s got Alzheimer\u2019s or someone who has a heart condition or someone who was born with a rare immunodeficiency,\u201d said Sara Willette, who has been in isolation with her husband in Iowa since the state reported its first case of the virus, some 700 days ago. \u201cThe more protections that we remove, the less accessible the rest of the world becomes to people who are high-risk,\u201d Willette said.\n\nEven though Willette is triple vaccinated and preparing for her fourth shot, catching the virus could be deadly. She has Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder (CVID), meaning her body does not produce protective antibodies to defend itself against pathogens like bacteria or viruses.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into three sentences: Overthinking is an anxious tendency that I encounter often in my psychotherapy practice. There are many ways we tend to overthink, such as rehashing the past \u2014 replaying the same scenario over and over in our head. Worrying is another form, in which we obsess over what the future might bring.\n\nI can empathize. When I was younger, overthinking decreased my quality of life. Research has shown that overthinking can decrease energy, limit creativity and cause sleeping problems.\n\nEventually, I knew I needed a healthy way to cope, and I created a career out of helping other people do the same. Here are three strategies I use every day to stop overthinking:\n1. Positive reframing\n\nThis is often confused with \u201ctoxic positivity,\u201d which asks people to think positively \u2014 no matter how difficult a situation is.\n\nPositive reframing, on the other hand, allows you to acknowledge the negative aspects, then asks you to evaluate whether there\u2019s another way to think about the situation. Perhaps there are benefits or things you can change about it.\n\nExample:\n\nYou constantly find yourself complaining: \u201cI hate being a boss. On top of all these deadlines and responsibilities, it\u2019s hard to manage so many complex personalities. It\u2019s emotionally and mentally exhausting. My job just sucks.\u201d\n\nVenting might feel good for a second, but it doesn\u2019t solve anything. And you\u2019ll likely continue to dwell on how much you hate your job or how bad you think you are at managing.\n\nTo practice positive reframing, replace the thought above with: \u201cThings are challenging right now and I\u2019m feeling disconnected from some things on my plate. I wonder if I can change anything about this situation or my expectations about it.\u201d\n\nThis thought pattern gives you the power to change your situation. You could start small by examining what important tasks needs to get done first, then either delay or delegate the rest until you are feeling less anxious. The key is to take a step back and deal with things one at a time.\n2. Write down your thoughts once, then distract yourself for 24 hours\n\nWhen our brains think we are in conflict or danger, a built-in alarm system goes off internally to protect us.\n\nOne thing I have found success with is writing down my feelings and waiting at least 24 hours (or just a few hours if it\u2019s an urgent matter) before replying or taking any sort of impulsive action.\n\nThen, I put that draft away while I distract myself with another task.\n\nExample:\n\nYou just received an email about something that went awry. You are upset, your heart starts to race, your breathing gets shallow, and you become hyper-focused on what\u2019s going wrong and why it\u2019s your fault.\n\nIf you respond to the email while your brain is in \u201calarm mode,\u201d you might say things you\u2019ll regret later on, which may then fuel the vicious cycle of overthinking.\n\nWriting negative thoughts down takes the power out of them; I often don\u2019t feel the need to take action based on my anxious thoughts once I\u2019ve written them down. \n3. Practice \u2018specific gratitude\u2019\n\nIn psychology, we know that expressing gratitude can increase our happiness. It can help us contextualize our frustrations against what we love and help us connect to something larger than ourselves \u2014 whether that\u2019s other people, animals, nature or a higher power.\n\nBut I find that repeating the same gratitude practice over and over again can become rote and diminish the returns. For me, it can start to feel like a meaningless chore instead of a mindful practice. So, I like to practice something that I call \u201cspecific gratitude.\u201d\n\nExample:\n\nInstead of writing in my journal every day that \u201cI am grateful for my health,\u201d I\u2019ll write something like, \u201cI am grateful that I woke up today without any back pain and have the ability to do today\u2019s workout.\u201d\n\nThis helps me stay focused on the here and now, rather than overthinking on general abstractions. Tomorrow, I might still be grateful for my health, but I might specifically be grateful that I have enough energy for a long run."}

{"prompt": "Forty years ago, Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash while on tour with Ozzy Osbourne in Florida. The classically trained metal guitarist was only 25 years old when he died, and had only come onto the scene recently as the guitarist and co-songwriter for Osbourne's first two solo albums. Yet he left behind an incredible, indelible legacy thanks to his lightning-speed, virtuosic soloing, which helped define the \u201880s metal sound and influenced guitarists for decades to come. In fact, just last year, Rhoads was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRhoads\u2019s pal Rudy Sarzo, who played with the legend in the late-\u201870s, pre-fame Quiet Riot lineup and was recruited by Rhoads to play bass for Osbourne in 1981 \u2014 and was present at the crash and nearly boarded the plane that day \u2014 has had a major part in keeping his late bandmate\u2019s legacy alive for decades. He even wrote a book, Off the Rails: Aboard the Crazy Train in the Blizzard of Ozz about his bond with the guitar god.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I wrote the book,\u201d Sarzo tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cI wrote it because I have to go back. Sometimes I go back as a spectator, and that way, I avoid feeling the pain again. I go back and I actually see myself in the place at the moment, but I'm disconnected from it, because it\u2019s like I'm watching myself go through this. But for this [Yahoo interview], I had to go in as myself, rather than as a witness. But it is my choice to do that \u2014 because it is very important that I am able to convey the emotion of what happened that day.\u201d\n\nCan you summarize this in a professional and concise way?"}

It starred Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe, and Cillian Murphy, among others. It collected a whopping $48 million at the box office on its opening weekend, which was the biggest three-day haul of the pandemic era then.\n\nA Quiet Place follows the story of the Abbot family as they try to navigate a post-apocalyptic world where they have to remain silent to survive. It grossed around $340 million in the box office in 2018 and received several nominations in 2019, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, Academy Awards for Sound Editing, BAFTA Awards for Sound, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where Emily Blunt won Outstanding Performance By A Female Actor In A Supporting Role."}

Taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony is an emotional moment for many immigrants, and for good reason: it is the culmination of an often arduous process and many years of striving. Citizenship also opens a new chapter marked by possibility, from better job prospects to full participation in civic life.\n\nYet for many immigrants who aspire to become U.S. citizens, that moment never arrives. Since the 1970s, naturalization rates in the United States have lagged behind those of other major host countries. It\u2019s a striking disparity given that the vast majority of immigrants in the United States express interest in citizenship. And since gaining citizenship often boosts immigrants\u2019 social mobility and integration, the fact that so many are left behind points to a troubling loss of solidarity for their host communities.\n\nWhat holds them back? Why are some immigrants more likely than others to complete the naturalization process?\n\nIPL research provides the first concrete evidence of a major barrier to citizenship for low-income immigrants. The findings help explain why citizenship-promotion efforts face significant challenges, and they provide a blueprint for solutions to ensure that all immigrants have equal access to citizenship and its benefits.\n\nA Life-Changing Program\nIn seeking to understand disparities in naturalization patterns, previous studies have focused on the immigrants themselves\u2014individual characteristics like language skills, resources, or country of origin. Here, the researchers considered an external factor out of immigrants\u2019 control: the high costs of the citizenship application process.\n\nFor many low-income immigrants, the price tag is daunting: $725 just to file the application, plus hundreds or even thousands more if you need English classes or consultations with immigration lawyers. Charitable organizations have stepped up to provide free language training, legal advice, and help navigating the paperwork. But the application fee has only become more burdensome, rising by 800 percent in real terms since 1985, when it was $35 (or $80.25 in today\u2019s dollars). The federal government offers a fee waiver for the poorest immigrants\u2014those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line\u2014but for many others who aren\u2019t destitute but struggle to make ends meet, that fee alone can put citizenship out of reach.\n\nTo address this potentially pivotal financial obstacle, IPL teamed up with the New York State Office for New Americans (ONA) and two funders dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable New Yorkers, Robin Hood and New York Community Trust. Together we developed an innovative, public-private program called NaturalizeNY, which offers low-income immigrants an opportunity to win a voucher covering the naturalization application fee.\n\nVeyom Bahl, a managing director at Robin Hood, said, \u201cRobin Hood is proud to partner with the world-class researchers at the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab. Like us, they are committed to helping immigrant families build a strong footing for a new life in the United States. This research will help foundations, community-based organizations, and policymakers alike re-think how we invest in our communities for maximum impact.\u201d\n\nNaturalizeNY also connects registrants with application assistance from ONA\u2019s network of nonprofit service providers. New York\u2019s leading immigrant service organizations, including CUNY Citizenship Now!, Hispanic Federation, and Catholic Charities, were also integral in promoting and implementing the program.\n\n\u201cThis was a truly first-of-a-kind program, where a state agency, philanthropies, academics, and nonprofits created a way to provide direct financial support to help low-income immigrants apply for citizenship. The Immigration Policy Lab was excited to partner in its design and evaluation so everyone involved could understand its impact on immigrants and the New York community,\u201d said Michael Hotard, an IPL program manager."}

Did the WNBA player do something to offend Russians? \"The arrest of two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist Brittney Griner has left supporters anxious about her well-being and fearful that she might become a political pawn.\n\nRussian authorities said Griner had cannabis oil in her luggage and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance \u2013 an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear exactly when Griner was arrested last month, or where she\u2019s being detained now.\n\nBut escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has stoked concerns that getting Griner out of Russia will be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Adaora Elonu, a former WBNA player who has also played in Russia, said she was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about Griner. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just very, very concerned \u2013 also knowing that she\u2019s been there for quite some time,\u201d Elonu told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nShe described feeling detached from much of the world while living in Russia. \u201cBeing in Russia, I was kind of in a bubble,\u201d Elonu said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel unsafe. I felt as if there was not much happening in that country. I know there was a lot going on outside of the country. But as far as when I was in Russia, we weren\u2019t getting much news about what was happening. Aside from my family and friends and my agent, they were letting me know about what was happening. But it was hard to balance what was actually happening and what I felt,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut once things started escalating, my agent was definitely pushing for me to get out. And I\u2019m glad I listened to his advice and got out.\u201d\n\n\u2018There are no words to express this pain\u2019\nGriner\u2019s whereabouts aren\u2019t publicly known. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment but has not heard back. A member of Russia\u2019s Federal Customs Service described the charge against Griner to Russia 24, the country\u2019s main state-owned news channel.\n\n\u201cA criminal case has been opened against an American citizen under section 2 of 229 YK RF (Russian law) for smuggling of a significant amount of drugs,\u201d Irina Begisheva of the Main Directorate for the Fight Against Smuggling of the Federal Customs Service told Russia 24.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Griner\u2019s wife described the agony of waiting.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018stay busy.\u2019 Yet, there\u2019s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.\u201d Cherelle Griner posted Monday.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express this pain. I\u2019m hurting, we\u2019re hurting.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, she thanked supporters and asked for privacy \u201cas we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.\u201d But a member of the US House Armed Services Committee said \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult\u201d to get Griner out of Russia.\n\n\u201cOur diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\u201d Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cPerhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cRussia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws\u201d \u2013 though it\u2019s not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner\u2019s case. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.\u201d\n\nGriner\u2019s high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she worries Griner\u2019s case will be used for political purposes.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear is that ... she will become a political pawn,\u201d Jackson told CNN.\n\nBut the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe best news we got today was that they know about it and that she\u2019s on the agenda,\u201d Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner\u2019s hometown of Houston, told reporters.\n\nNoting a potential 10-year sentence for Griner, Jackson Lee added: \u201cWe know about Brittney Griner, and we know that we have to move on her situation.\u201d\n\nA storied career\nGriner has spent her entire WNBA career with the Phoenix Mercury and won the league\u2019s championship in 2014. The WNBA has confirmed that all other league players have departed Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLike many other WNBA players, Griner plays overseas in the offseason where salaries can be much higher than what female professional basketball players are paid in the US.\n\nShe won the EuroLeague Women championship last year with Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she has played since 2015 during her offseasons.\n\nFans around the world have called for Griner\u2019s release, with more than 34,000 people signing the \u201cSecure Brittney Griner\u2019s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.\u201d petition on Change.org as of Tuesday.\""}

{"prompt": "Referring the article below, could you summarize it into two sentences?\n\nThe Dreamachine (a contraction of Dream Machine) is a stroboscopic flicker device that produces visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7]"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this article on sleep talking in bullet point format?\n\nBy definition, sleep talking is a disorder that sufferers don\u2019t know they have. When they find out, fear quickly follows: Did I say something embarrassing? Reveal my inner desires? My deepest, darkest secret? New research from the Sorbonne reveals that our sleep speech isn\u2019t usually that saucy. But it can reveal clues into our dreams \u2013 and unravel mysteries about the sleeping brain.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, Dr. Isabelle Arnulf and her team at the European Sleep Research Laboratories found that we follow the same speech patterns while we sleep as we do when we\u2019re awake. We use proper syntax, mind our grammar, and pause for imaginary respondents to participate in the conversation. We are, however, three times more negative and 800 times more likely to curse as we slumber.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t disclose personal secrets, but you may allude to things or people you encountered during the day. According to Dr. Deirdre Barrett, Harvard professor and \u201cThe Committee of Sleep\u201d author, sleep talking is usually provocative. But it\u2019s mostly fanciful, fictional material, so we shouldn\u2019t take sleep talking too seriously. Dr. Arnulf told us that it\u2019s often difficult to understand sleep speech anyway: \u201cThe mean number of understandable words uttered per night is 15 in women and 22 in men.\u201d\n\nIt varies by subject, but sleep speech tends to be \u201cnegative, interrogative, and brief.\u201d Several researchers have found that sleep talk is mostly heated conversations with an unidentified \u201cyou.\u201d Nearly 10 percent of the sleep talk in Dr. Arnulf\u2019s study contained profanities, and \u201cno\u201d was the most frequently spoken term. Men were both more likely to talk in their sleep and more likely to curse.\n\nDr. Arnulf\u2019s team has come up with multiple possible reasons we\u2019re so aggressive as we snooze. She hypothesizes that it\u2019s probably because sleep talk is related to our dreams, which tend to be more negative than positive. According to Arnulf, it could also be that some parts of our frontal lobe aren\u2019t connected during sleep or that sleep talk only represents the last, but most emotive part of a longer dream sequence.\n\nSleep talking has long been linked to anxiety. Dr. Nerina Ramlakhan, sleep therapist and author of \u201cFast Asleep Wide Awake,\u201d told us that we talk in our sleep to express unresolved conflict and stress. She says that those who keep their feelings bottled up during the day are more likely to spill in their sleep. She\u2019s also found that stimulants like technology, caffeine, and alcohol activate our nervous system and lead to greater incidences of sleep talking. Eating well, reducing exposure to such stimulants, and keeping a journal can help you kick the habit. Getting enough sleep is also key, as sleep deprived individuals tend to sleep talk more.\n\nThere are, however, natural predispositions for sleep talking as well. Dr. Barrett told us that sleep talking is more common in children, with between 22-60 percent of the young population speaking in their sleep at least occasionally. In the Sorbonne study, Dr. Arnulf found that people who talked in their sleep as children were more likely to talk in their sleep as adults.\n\nSleep talking may also be hereditary, as you\u2019re more likely to talk in your sleep if you come from a family of sleep talkers. Dr. Barrett pointed us to a Finnish study of twins, which highlighted heritability for both sleepwalking and sleep talking. It turns out you\u2019re also more likely to talk in your sleep if you walk in your sleep.\n\nSleep talking is usually rare and short-lived. Most cases are innocent and don\u2019t require treatment. Sleep talking is actually a bigger problem to partners than the talkers themselves. Dr. Barrett suggests that those with sleep talking partners invest in earplugs or move to a separate bed.\n\nHowever, if you start sleep talking after a traumatic experience, you may want to consult a professional. And if you\u2019re suffering from excessive daytime fatigue on top of sleep talking, it could indicate something more serious. As a rule of thumb, you should seek a specialist\u2019s help if you\u2019re sleep talking several nights a month or if you\u2019re exhibiting other disruptive sleep behaviors, like shouting or kicking, too.\n\nProfessor Arnulf\u2019s study found that the sleeping brain uses the same networks as the waking one, indicating that sleep is not the \u201cpassive, isolated state\u201d people once believed it to be. In fact, our brains function at an extremely high level as we sleep, activating both the frontal and temporal lobes. Perhaps most impressive, our sleeping brains seem able to hallucinate conversations in real time.\n\nThis research is widely believed to be the largest sleep talking study ever conducted. Arnulf believes the difficulty of capturing sleep-talking data could be why more scientists aren\u2019t going further. Her team recorded more than 15,000 sleeping people over five years to gather just 232 recordings of coherent sleep talk. She encourages her peers to continue pushing the subject though. Sleep talking studies offer a foundation for solving some of the remaining mysteries about sleep.\n\nPlus, it can be fun. Dr. Barrett\u2019s research has shown that a sleep talker can arouse their bed partner into conversation, creating whacky dialogues. In one recording, someone said, \u201cYou\u2019re talking in your sleep,\u201d and the other responded, \u201cNo, you\u2019re talking in your sleep!\u201d In truth, they both were. Very meta \u2014 and entertaining.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to hear what you say in bed, try downloading a sleep talk recorder app. You just may discover what you\u2019ve been dreaming about. At the very least, you\u2019ll get a funny story."}

The well built reinforced building with its arched arcades survived both the 1906 and the 1989 earthquakes with little damage. It served as the destination for commuters to San Francisco from the East Bay, who rode the ferry fleets of the Southern Pacific and the Key System. It also served as the connection to San Francisco for the transcontinental rail lines of the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Western Pacific which terminated in Oakland, and for the Northwestern Pacific running north from Marin County. The ferry piers north of the clock tower served the Key System, Santa Fe, and Northwestern Pacific, while the piers south of the tower served the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific.[4] A loop track in front of the building enabled convenient transfers to streetcars. A large pedestrian bridge spanned the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry building to facilitate safe crossing of the busy plaza and transit hub. In the 1940s, the bridge was dismantled to supply scrap metal for the Second World War.\n\nUntil the completion of the Bay Bridge (which began to carry railroad traffic) and Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s, the Ferry Building was the second busiest transit terminal in the world, second only to London's Charing Cross Station. After the bridges opened, and the new Key System and Southern Pacific (Interurban Electric/IER) trains began running to the East Bay from the Transbay Terminal in 1939, passenger ferry use fell sharply. In the second half of the 20th century, although the Ferry Building and its clock tower remained a part of the San Francisco skyline, the condition of the building interior declined with changes. Beginning in the 1950s, unsympathetic renovations installed a mezzanine level, broke up the grand space of the Great Nave, and partitioned the ticketing counters and waiting room areas into office space. The formerly grand public space was reduced to a narrow and dark corridor, through which travelers passed en route to the piers. Passengers were made to wait for ferries on outdoor benches, and the ticketing booths were moved to the pier.[5]\n\n\nEmbaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building, February 1982\nIn the late 1950s, the Embarcadero Freeway was built, which passed right in front of the Ferry Building, and views of the once-prominent landmark were greatly obscured from Market Street. Pedestrian access was treated as an afterthought, and the public was cut off from the waterfront.[5]\n\nMarket Street Railway services terminated at a loop in front of the building prior to the construction of the Transbay Terminal. The last streetcars ran on July 2, 1949.[6]\n\nWith the structural failure of the Embarcadero Freeway during the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco was offered the choice of whether to rebuild it or remove the freeway and reconnect the city with the eastern waterfront and the historic Ferry Building. As part of the larger rejection of the 1950s comprehensive freeway plan as unsympathetic to the city's character, and the general unpopularity of the freeway, Mayor Art Agnos led the charge to remove the Embarcadero freeway entirely. It was replaced with a ground-level boulevard, which reconnected a significant portion of San Francisco's waterfront and the rest of the city. Access was restored to Embarcadero Plaza (previously Justin Herman Plaza) and the foot of Market Street, of which the Ferry Building had been an integral part for so many decades."}

Even as we adjust and begin learning to navigate our post-COVID reality, you can count on it to still cause more significant shifts, especially in business.\nHow much more will the landscape change as we flux between opening up and lockdowns brought about by surges? How will these impact the trajectory of small businesses? How will they scale without teetering on the edge of closing?\nWith these insights, your business can be prepared for this coming year.\nIn the Philippines (as with the rest of the world), e-commerce is booming. \nDuring last December\u2019s Philippine Startup Week 2021, citing data from Google, Temasek, and Bain and Company, these key figures regarding the Philippines\u2019 e-commerce scene were reported:\n\u2022\t132% e-commerce growth in the past year;\n\u2022\tNew digital consumers are up to 12 million, and;\n\u2022\t99% of digital consumers are likely to continue using e-commerce.\nBut while those figures spell out hope for Philippine MSMEs, they also point out challenges. Small businesses can look forward to recovering from the blows of the pandemic but not without adequate support. \nTo start things off, there\u2019s an increasing concern about data privacy. In response to loudening calls for better data privacy protection online, tech giants are slowly rolling out their own restrictions for data tracking. \nApple, for instance, rolled out the iOS 14 security update that imposed restrictions on user data tracking by App Store publishers earlier this year. This was welcomed by users who are wary of data breaches as an added protective measure, so we may soon see similar updates rolling out from other tech companies.\nIn light of this, you\u2019ll have to reassess how well-equipped you are in safeguarding your organization\u2019s consumer data privacy and how transparent you are with these practices. Remember: A consumer that trusts you is one that will most likely convert.\nUltimately, protecting your customers\u2019 data privacy is non-negotiable in digital marketing \u2013 even if it comes at the cost of generating reports for your online marketing efforts. At the end of the day, resolving that issue is just a matter of optimizing your ad campaigns and finding creative and relevant ways to reach out to your existing customers."}

{"prompt": "I require a catchy headline for the following article outlne. Can you help? - Researcher Kristin Neff distinguishes in her TED talk between self-esteem and self-compassion. While Neff says self-esteem comes from believing we are better than others, self-compassion directs us to love ourselves simply as we are. Self-compassion was shown in one study to help improve body dissatisfaction and motivate people to continue self-improvement efforts. Neff says self-compassion can be as simple as changing the language we use with ourselves. For example, if you went ahead and ate that damn cookie, don't beat yourself up for it. Instead of thinking how terrible you are for eating the cookie, remind yourself that you'll do better tomorrow.\n\n\"Exercise is as much a physical training as mental,\" says Sassy Gregson-Williams, founder of Naturally Sassy, a Global Online Workout Studio, Recipe Platform and App. \"These patterns are so ingrained in us, we want instantaneous results, and if we stray from that narrow unattainable path we set for ourselves we feel defeated.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me?\n\nA new analysis of Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains reveals physical differences in the femur, other bones, and dental structures across specimens that could suggest Tyrannosaurus rex specimens need to be re-categorized into three distinct groups or species, reports a study published in Evolutionary Biology.\n\nTyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs, or genus, Tyrannosaurus to date. Previous research has acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains in the femur (thighbone) and specimens with either one or two slender incisor teeth on each side of front ends of the jaw.\n\nGregory Paul and colleagues analyzed the bones and dental remains of 37 Tyrannosaurus specimens. The authors compared the robustness of the femur in 24 of the specimens, a measure calculated from the length and circumference that gives an indication of the strength of the bone. They also measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender incisiform teeth.\n\nThe authors observed that the femur varied across specimens, some with more robust femurs and others with more gracile femurs. The authors found there were two times more robust femurs than gracile ones across specimens, which suggests that this is not a difference caused by sex, which would likely result in a more even split. The authors also suggest that the variation in femurs is not related to growth of the specimen as robust femurs were found in some juvenile specimens two thirds the size of an adult and gracile femurs were found in some specimens that were full adult size.\n\nDental structure also varied across specimens, although those with both femur measurements and dental remains was low (12 specimens). Specimens with one incisor tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.\n\nOf the Tyrannosaurus specimens, 28 could be identified in distinct layers of sediment (stratigraphy) at the Lancian upper Masstrichtian formations in North America (estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago). The authors compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.\n\nOnly robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment (six femurs). The variation of femur robustness in the lower layer was not different to that of other theropod species, which indicates that likely only one species of Tyrannosaurus existed at this point. Only one gracile Tyrannosaurus femur was identified in the middle layer with five other gracile femurs in the upper layer, alongside other robust femurs. The variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher than what was observed in some earlier theropod specimens. This suggests that the Tyrannosaurus specimens found at higher layers of sediment physically developed into more distinct forms compared to specimens from lower layers, and other dinosaur species.\n\nGregory Paul, lead author, said: \u201cWe found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen. We propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.\u201d\n\nThe authors nominate two potential new species of Tyrannosaurus based on their analysis. The first, Tyrannosaurus imperator (tyrant lizard emperor), relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, characterized with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth. The authors argue these features have been retained from earlier ancestors (tyrannosaurids). The second, Tyrannosaurus regina (tyrant lizard queen), is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, characterized with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The recognized species Tyrannosaurus rex (tyrant lizard king) was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment with specimens classed as retaining more robust femurs while having only one incisor tooth. Some specimens could not be identified based on their remains so were not assigned to a species.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that they cannot rule out that the observed variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups, and they also caution that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. The authors discuss the difficulties of assigning fossil vertebrates to a potential new species.\n\nThe authors conclude that the physical variation found in Tyrannosaurus specimens combined with their stratigraphy are indicative of three potential groups that could be nominated as two new species, T. imperator and T. regina, alongside the only recognized species to date, T. rex."}

The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) with ten teams from four states, all of whom existed in some form as participants of regional leagues in their respective territories. The league took on its current name in 1922. The NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts.[citation needed] Only two founding members, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are still in the league.[1] The Green Bay Acme Packers, founded in 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921, now the Green Bay Packers) is the oldest NFL franchise with continuous operation in the same location.\n\nLeague membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America Football Conference in 1950, of which only the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns survive to the present day. By 1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as \"the most exiting game ever played\", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.\n\nThe rival American Football League was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts have helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games."}

Taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony is an emotional moment for many immigrants, and for good reason: it is the culmination of an often arduous process and many years of striving. Citizenship also opens a new chapter marked by possibility, from better job prospects to full participation in civic life.\n\nYet for many immigrants who aspire to become U.S. citizens, that moment never arrives. Since the 1970s, naturalization rates in the United States have lagged behind those of other major host countries. It\u2019s a striking disparity given that the vast majority of immigrants in the United States express interest in citizenship. And since gaining citizenship often boosts immigrants\u2019 social mobility and integration, the fact that so many are left behind points to a troubling loss of solidarity for their host communities.\n\nWhat holds them back? Why are some immigrants more likely than others to complete the naturalization process?\n\nIPL research provides the first concrete evidence of a major barrier to citizenship for low-income immigrants. The findings help explain why citizenship-promotion efforts face significant challenges, and they provide a blueprint for solutions to ensure that all immigrants have equal access to citizenship and its benefits.\n\nA Life-Changing Program\nIn seeking to understand disparities in naturalization patterns, previous studies have focused on the immigrants themselves\u2014individual characteristics like language skills, resources, or country of origin. Here, the researchers considered an external factor out of immigrants\u2019 control: the high costs of the citizenship application process.\n\nFor many low-income immigrants, the price tag is daunting: $725 just to file the application, plus hundreds or even thousands more if you need English classes or consultations with immigration lawyers. Charitable organizations have stepped up to provide free language training, legal advice, and help navigating the paperwork. But the application fee has only become more burdensome, rising by 800 percent in real terms since 1985, when it was $35 (or $80.25 in today\u2019s dollars). The federal government offers a fee waiver for the poorest immigrants\u2014those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line\u2014but for many others who aren\u2019t destitute but struggle to make ends meet, that fee alone can put citizenship out of reach.\n\nTo address this potentially pivotal financial obstacle, IPL teamed up with the New York State Office for New Americans (ONA) and two funders dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable New Yorkers, Robin Hood and New York Community Trust. Together we developed an innovative, public-private program called NaturalizeNY, which offers low-income immigrants an opportunity to win a voucher covering the naturalization application fee.\n\nVeyom Bahl, a managing director at Robin Hood, said, \u201cRobin Hood is proud to partner with the world-class researchers at the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab. Like us, they are committed to helping immigrant families build a strong footing for a new life in the United States. This research will help foundations, community-based organizations, and policymakers alike re-think how we invest in our communities for maximum impact.\u201d\n\nNaturalizeNY also connects registrants with application assistance from ONA\u2019s network of nonprofit service providers. New York\u2019s leading immigrant service organizations, including CUNY Citizenship Now!, Hispanic Federation, and Catholic Charities, were also integral in promoting and implementing the program.\n\n\u201cThis was a truly first-of-a-kind program, where a state agency, philanthropies, academics, and nonprofits created a way to provide direct financial support to help low-income immigrants apply for citizenship. The Immigration Policy Lab was excited to partner in its design and evaluation so everyone involved could understand its impact on immigrants and the New York community,\u201d said Michael Hotard, an IPL program manager."}

The helicopter has now traveled more than 4.6 kilometers since its first flight in April 2021.\n\nIngenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, with an original plan of no more than five flights over a month. The excellent performance of the 1.8-kilogram helicopter, though, led NASA to extend its mission, using it as a scout to examine terrain ahead of the Perseverance rover that carried Ingenuity to Mars.\n\nThe information Ingenuity has provided has created some modest time savings for Perseverance. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly shaved several sols, maybe a week, off of the time frame of the rover by having this advanced information,\u201d said Matt Golombek, a senior research scientist at JPL who has been involved with Mars landers dating back to Mars Pathfinder, during a March 8 media briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference. A sol is a Martian day, about 40 minutes longer than a terrestrial day.\n\nOther scientists involved with Perseverance agreed that Ingenuity has been useful. \u201cI was really impressed with how well it worked and how useful it\u2019s been,\u201d said Justin Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center who works on the Perseverance mission, during a conference session March 7. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was fully anticipated, at least by myself.\u201d\n\nKeyron Hickman-Lewis of the U.K.\u2019s Natural History Museum, another Perseverance scientist, said at that conference session that Ingenuity has been particularly helpful as Perseverance negotiated a region called S\u00e9\u00edtah. \u201cThe terrain is not optimal for a rover,\u201d he said of the region. \u201cThese insights have been invaluable.\u201d\n\nThat work will continue as Perseverance heads in the coming weeks to the remnants of a river delta. \u201cThe intent is to keep the helicopter out in front of the rover to provide advance information that would help in its exploration,\u201d Golombek said. That includes scouting paths the rover could take into the delta and identifying rocks for the rover to study with its instrument suite.\n\nIngenuity itself has shown no signs of wear and tear after nearly a year of flying on Mars. \u201cSo far, we have found no degradation or loss of anything on the helicopter. It is as good as new,\u201d he said.\n\nThe helicopter, which uses solar power, also has no consumables to limit its life. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing consumable and nothing to stop us from continuing to operate as long as the helicopter remains healthy,\u201d he said, with the expectation Ingenuity will continue operations until something finally breaks.\n\nThat performance is all the more noteworthy, he added, because of the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts that had been previously qualified for space on Ingenuity, rather than customized components. \u201cIt is rather remarkable that we\u2019ve had no degradation or loss of any aspect of the helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\nGolombek said the performance of Ingenuity demonstrates how useful such helicopters could be in future exploration, although NASA has no firm plans currently for additional helicopter missions. \u201cThe idea of a technology demo is to demonstrate that here is a new way to explore Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cIngenuity has shown the promise of this sort of way to continue our exploration of the red planet.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into TWO SHORT sentences? \n\nWhat Is Synthetic Cubism? Here\u2019s How to Recognize It\n\nCubism was one of the most monumental art movements of the early 20th century. Some even say it was so radical, it marked the true beginning of modern art. Cubists broke apart the pictorial conventions of realism and perspective, replacing them with shattered forms and angular, geometric shards. It was a relatively short-lived movement that lasted from 1908 to around 1914, but in those six years a huge range of avant-garde artwork was made. To try and make sense of it all, art historians have divided Cubism into two distinct phases: Analytical Cubism (1908-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-14). In this article we ask, what is Synthetic Cubism, and how can we recognize it?\n\nSynthetic Cubism Is the Second Phase of Cubism\n\nSynthetic Cubism is a term commonly used by art historians to describe the second phase of the Cubist movement, emerging during and after Analytical Cubism. The first phase of Cubism was generally defined by complex designs, multiple perspective, and muted color schemes. In contrast, by 1912 Cubist artists began incorporating elements of found materials and collage. The word \u2018synthetic\u2019 was a reference to the incorporation of man-made materials such as newspaper, patterned paper and other textured surfaces.\n\n \n\nIn fact, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque \u2013 the two leading Cubist pioneers \u2013 are often credited with inventing the art of collage (or papier colle) during this phase in their career. The result of pasting real world textures and elements into art was a further flattening of the picture plane, removing the illusion of depth that we see in earlier Cubist art. This idea that items from the real world could be cut up and stuck into artworks rather than depicted with a brush was entirely new, and it opened up exciting new pathways into making art.\n\n \n\nMore Artists Were Involved in Synthetic Cubism\n\nWhile the first phase of Analytical Cubism was essentially founded by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, by 1912 their radical ideas had attracted a wider pool of artists from throughout Europe and beyond. Along with Picasso and Braque these include Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Fernand Leger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Archipenko, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov and even Diego Rivera. They began taking earlier Cubist ideas and expanding them in new directions, experimenting with different materials, surfaces, colors and patterns.\n\nWe might even call Synthetic Cubism the fun younger sibling of Cubism, learning ideas from its serious analytical and intellectual elder and injecting them with an anarchic new spirit. Art in this school had a defined geometric, constructed feel, so even if it wasn\u2019t made from collaged pieces, it was made to look that way. Sometimes artists did this by imitating the texture of found surfaces, such as wood grain or newspaper, into their art.\n\nSynthetic Cubists Made Sculptures\n\nWhile Analytical Cubism was generally a painting movement, Synthetic Cubism incorporated many new approaches to making art. These included collage, low relief construction and sculpture. In Picasso\u2019s art we see how he made flat collages featuring newspaper cut-outs, paper doilies and other textured surfaces, before moving into cardboard constructions made with the same broad, flat planes of texture. French sculptor Raymond Duchamp-Villon made sturdier sculptures in cast bronze, but they have the same pieced together, layered quality typical of Synthetic Cubism, combining animal and machine parts into one. \n\n \n\nSynthetic Cubism Was a Gateway into Lots of Other Art Movements \n\nSynthetic Cubism broke new ground with its adventurous, subversive approach to image making, paving the way for numerous art movements to follow all across the world. These include Futurism, Constructivism, Rayonism, Dadaism, Surrealism and much, much more. Even today the influence of Synthetic Cubism can still be seen in contemporary works of art that explore elements of collage, construction and the incorporation of everyday items into art. Examples include Phyllida Barlow\u2019s monumental constructions made from household junk. At the other end of the spectrum, John Stezaker\u2019s eerie, spliced photographs transform found photographs into haunting art objects through the simple art of cut and paste first pioneered by the Synthetic Cubists."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty."}

{"prompt": "What is this article about - March 17 (Reuters) - Thirty five generic drugmakers around the world will make cheap versions of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) highly effective COVID-19 oral antiviral Paxlovid to supply the treatment in 95 poorer countries, the U.N.-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) said on Thursday.\n\nPfizer struck a deal last year with the group to allow generic drugmakers to make the pills for 95 low- and middle-income countries. They have been working since then to select the drugmakers they will license.\n\nPaxlovid is expected to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 after it reduced hospitalizations in high-risk patients by around 90% in a clinical trial. The results were significantly better than those for Merck & Co's (MRK.N) rival antiviral pill molnupiravir in its clinical trial.\n\nPfizer and Merck both struck deals with MPP to allow generic versions of their new drugs in some parts of the world, a rarity for pharmaceutical companies that usually fiercely protect their treatments over the life of their patents.\n\nMerck, on its own and through the MPP license, has deals with dozens of drugmakers to make its pill and generic versions are already available in some countries. read more\n\nBut Pfizer and MPP do not expect any of generic drugmakers to be able to manufacture significant supplies of Paxlovid before the end of the year.\n\nThe 35 companies that will produce versions of Paxlovid or its active ingredient are based in 12 different countries, the MPP said. They include some of the world's largest generic manufacturers like Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), India-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (SUN.NS), and U.S.-based Viatris Inc (VTRS.O).\n\nSix of the companies will make the main ingredient for the drug, nine plan to turn that into a finished product and the remaining companies will do both.\n\nPaxlovid is a two-drug treatment that pairs a new compound, nirmatrelvir, with the older antiviral ritonavir, which is already available as a generic.\n\nPfizer will not receive royalties from the sale of the generic versions of its drug while COVID-19 remains classified as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" by the World Health Organization.\n\nFollowing the pandemic period, sales to low-income countries will remain royalty free, lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries will be subject to a 5% royalty for sales to the public sector and a 10% royalty for sales to the private sector, MPP said.\n\nPfizer has said it plans to produce at least 120 million treatment courses of the treatment this year, well short of its estimate of the 2022 market for antiviral pills of 250 million people globally.\n\nThe company is also expected to provide around 10 million courses Paxlovid it produces to low- and middle-income countries this year, according to an official with the Global Fund, a healthcare NGO working to buy the pills from the drugmaker."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a brief synopsis of this article please?                                                                                                                                                  Americans are acutely sensitive to gasoline prices, especially when they\u2019re on the rise. One reason, of course, is that we buy a lot of gas: an estimated 570 gallons this year for the average driver, which at current national average prices would cost close to $2,000. Also, gas prices are posted all over town on large signs \u2013 unlike, say, milk prices \u2013 and people typically buy gas on its own rather than as part of a larger shopping trip, making price changes more noticeable. And gas prices can and do swing sharply and unpredictably, in ways that can seem unconnected to the rest of the economy.\n\nRegular gas costs, on average, 58.7% more than it did a year ago this time \u2013 $3.491 a gallon last month, versus $2.20 in November 2020, according to the federal Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nBut looking just at the recent rise can be misleading, or at least incomplete. For one thing, a year ago the United States was battling yet another wave of COVID-19 cases, large parts of the economy were still shuttered and demand for gas was way down. Estimated consumption in 2020 was 534 gallons per driver, down 14.4% from 624 gallons in 2019."}

Dallas is currently only one point back of Nashville and Vegas with games on hand against both. The loss of Miro Heiskanen earlier this week is something to keep an eye on given how close the wild card race is right now but don\u2019t be surprised if Dallas finds their way into the playoffs this year.\n\nVancouver is also only trailing a wild card berth by three points. They had a very rough start to the season but the mid-season hiring of Bruce Boudreau has given them a serious jolt and turned things around for them entirely. Given Calgary\u2019s success in the playoffs against Vancouver historically, rooting for this matchup would be even more ideal for the Flames.\n\nWinnipeg is also not far behind, only out of the playoffs by four points. Winnipeg has had their struggles this season and Hellebuyck isn\u2019t having his best year, but it isn\u2019t totally over for the Jets quite yet.\n\nFinally Anaheim isn\u2019t totally out of it either. They had a very strong start and surprising start to their season but have since fallen off and are now five points out of a wild card spot."}

LDWF biologists and managers recommend shrimp seasons based on a shrimp species\u2019 annual life cycles and growth rates, which are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. LDWF biologists continually monitor shrimp populations and environmental conditions in Louisiana\u2019s marshes, coastal lakes, and bays. At hundreds of sample locations, they tow trawls through the water, count and identify the species they catch, measure a random selection of the shrimp catch, and record the data. They also record water conductivity, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels. They then compile the data and plug it into mathematical models. These models help biologists project when the majority of the shrimp population within each the state\u2019s major estuarine basins will reach market size. The Commission uses these projections to determine when and where to open and close the shrimp fishery. Adjusting seasons in response to the conditions that influence shrimp populations helps fishermen have more productive shrimping trips."}

What transpired afterward was a contentious exchange that unfolded on live television.\n\nViktor Hovland, who was paired with Berger, immediately pushed back on Berger\u2019s attempted drop just short of the green. \u201cI don\u2019t think it crossed up there,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got it on camera.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article entry:\nActivities\nSee also: Places of interest in the Death Valley area\nSightseeing is available by personal automobile, four-wheel drive, bicycle, mountain bike (on established roadways only), and hiking.[53] Riding through the park on motorcycle is also a popular pastime.[54] State Route 190, the Badwater Road, the Scotty's Castle Road, and paved roads to Dante's View and Wildrose provide access to the major scenic viewpoints and historic points of interest. More than 350 miles (560 km) of unpaved and four-wheel-drive roads provide access to wilderness hiking, camping, and historical sites.[55] All vehicles must be licensed and street legal. Unlike many other national parks in the U.S. there are no formal entrance stations, and instead entry fees can be paid at the visitor centers, ranger stations, or various fee machines around the park.[56] There are hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulties, but most backcountry areas are accessible only by cross-country hiking. There are thousands of hiking possibilities. The normal season for visiting the park is from October 15 to May 15, avoiding summer extremes in temperature. Costumed living history tours of the historic Death Valley Scotty's Castle were conducted for a fee, but were suspended in October 2015 due to flood damage to the buildings and grounds. It is not expected to re-open until 2020.[57][needs update]\n\n\nA tourist sliding down Star Dune in the Mesquite Flat dune field\nThere are nine designated campgrounds within the park, and overnight backcountry camping permits are available at the Visitor Center.[58] Xanterra Parks & Resorts owns and operates a private resort, the Oasis at Death Valley,[45] which comprises two separate and distinct hotels: the Inn at Death Valley is a four-star historic hotel, and the Ranch at Death Valley is a three-star ranch-style property reminiscent of the mining and prospecting days. Panamint Springs Resort is in the western part of the park. Death Valley Lodging Company operates the Stovepipe Wells Resort under a concession permit. There are a few motels near entrances to the park, in Shoshone, Death Valley Junction, Beatty, and Pahrump.\n\nFurnace Creek Visitor Center is located on CA-190. A 22-minute introductory slide program is shown every 30 minutes.[59] During the winter season\u2014November through April\u2014rangers offer interpretive tours and a wide variety of walks, talks, and slide presentations about Death Valley cultural and natural history. The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The Death Valley Natural History Association maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park.\n\nThe northeast corner of Saline Valley has several developed hot spring pools. The pools can be accessed by driving on the unpaved Saline Valley Road for several hours, or by flying a personal aircraft to the Chicken Strip\u2014an uncharted airstrip a short walk from the springs.[60]\n\nDeath Valley National Park is a popular location for stargazing as it has one of the darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its remote location, air quality and night visibility are threatened by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas.[61] The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.[62] The northwestern area of the park, including sites such as Ubehebe Crater, is a Bortle class 1 or \"excellent dark sky\" site.[63] The Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy are visible to the unaided eye under these conditions, and the Milky Way casts shadows; optical phenomena such as zodiacal light or \"false dawn\" and gegenschein are also visible to the unaided eye under these conditions.[64][65] Most southern regions of the park are Bortle class 2 or \"average dark sky\" sites.[66]"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize what this article says about the iPad Air?\n\nThe Apple iPad Air 2022 is one of the highest-rated tablets on Tom\u2019s Guide. Like its predecessor, the iPad Air 4, the new slate contains a lot of power within its slim, elegant frame. This is due in no small part to it packing the M1 chip, which helps the tablet zip between multiple open windows, watch streaming content and play games without a hitch. Put simply, the new iPad Air is a small wonder.\n\nIn my Apple iPad Air 2022 review, I said that the optional Magic Keyboard attachment turns the new iPad Air into a small laptop. My colleague Henry Casey shared a similar sentiment in his review of the previous model. Having a Magic Keyboard is what makes this seem like a good idea: Though I maintain that the Magic Keyboard is very expensive at $349, it\u2019s a crucial peripheral for those who want to get more use out of the iPad Air beyond its touch capabilities.\n\nThe iPad Air is certainly a fantastic tablet, but how well can it function as a laptop replacement? Our own Kelly Woo tried to use the iPad Air 4 for work while at the airport last year and found it lacking. But now there's a new iPad Air in town, and you might be wondering: Is this the iPad that will replace your laptop? Should it?\n\nThe short answer is, no. Though it makes a halfway decent laptop in a pinch, the new iPad Air still isn't as capable as the best Windows laptops or best MacBooks. Here's why.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard is good but not great\nAs I said in my iPad Air 2022 review, the Magic Keyboard is a solid peripheral. I think it\u2019s superior to the Book Cover Keyboard that you can purchase for the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for $349. While not a full keyboard, Apple's Magic Keyboard has enough space to let most people comfortably type on. The keys themselves also have a satisfying amount of resistance when you press them. \n\nDespite its strengths, the Magic Keyboard won\u2019t suit everyone. It works well for short typing sessions, but its small size becomes a factor if you try to use it for longer periods of time. My hands felt cramped after about an hour\u2019s worth of use. For comparison's sake, I think the Book Cover Keyboard is flimsy compared to the Magic Keyboard but I never had problems using its keyboard for long stretches. And obviously, neither pseudo-keyboard can match the effectiveness of the keyboards on laptops like the Alienware x14 or MacBook Pro 14-inch.\n\niPadOS can't compete with Windows or macOS\nWriters don\u2019t need many specialized applications to get work done. So long as I have access to Google and its suite of apps (Google Docs, Gmail and Drive), along with Slack and a photo editor like Photoshop, I\u2019m good to go. All of these apps are on the Apple App Store and can be used on the iPad Air.\n\nUsing these apps efficiently on an iPad takes some getting used to, especially if you\u2019re a Windows user like me. That isn\u2019t to say switching between apps and tabs is difficult. I didn\u2019t have major problems locating or opening the tabs I needed. I prefer an arrow cursor over the grey circle that pops up when using the Magic Keyboard's touchpad, but the circle works well enough. The pointer can feel slow at times, but when it does you can simply use the touch screen to scroll through pages. Working on an iPad takes some getting used to, but once you do it's a bit like working on a small, cramped touchscreen laptop running iPadOS.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of minor hassles that get in the way of working comfortably on an iPad Air. As Kelly said in her op-ed, not having access to Chrome extensions or bookmarks can considerably slow down your workflow. Another impediment is the small screen size. 10.9 inches is great for watching videos, but it\u2019s far too small if you want to have multiple windows on the display \u2013 even if you have perfect vision. Instead of having half the screen dedicated to Chrome and the other to Slack as I normally do, I opted to run Chrome in fullscreen mode and check Slack messages on my phone because of the small screen size.\n\nPhoto editing is cumbersome at best. The Magic Keyboard\u2019s trackpad is fairly accurate, but using it for photo manipulation isn\u2019t as precise as using a mouse cursor. However, if you get an Apple Pencil 2 ($99) it's not a bad option for editing photos, even if you aren\u2019t artistically inclined. Still, if you\u2019re used to cropping photos on a Windows laptop or desktop, you\u2019ll find trying to do the same job on the iPad Air less than ideal.\n\nCan the iPad Air 2022 replace your laptop? \nApple's new iPad Air is one of the best iPads we\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of testing. I love its vibrant screen, snappy touch controls and overall sleek, slender design. The iPad Air (2022) has earned a spot on our best tablets list for a reason: The tablet is just that good.\n\nBut even with all its strengths, the iPad Air won\u2019t replace your laptop. Though apps like Chrome and Photoshop technically function on the slate, these mobile iterations are awkward to work with compared to their Windows/macOS counterparts. The iPad Air\u2019s screen is also too small to accommodate multiple windows. And while the Magic Keyboard is a good (if expensive) peripheral, a proper keyboard is easier and more ergonomic to use for extended work sessions. There\u2019s also the fact that you can buy laptops (such as the best Chromebooks) for far less than $950, which is the minimum you'll pay for an iPad Air (2022) and Magic Keyboard together.\n\nAt best, the iPad Air can do double buty as a spare laptop when you don\u2019t have access to your primary notebook. But it won\u2019t replace your laptop anytime soon."}

{"prompt": "I'm trying to understand the differences between 3G and 4G. I think this article is saying that the only difference is the speed. Am I missing anything else? \"The wireless telecommunications technology has had a few big waves, and one of them was 3G (Third Generation). \n\nWhat was before that? \n\n1G allowed only analog voice transmission on first cell phones in the 1980s. 2G came around with the 1990s, and it is the first digital voice transmission service, in other words, our mobile call service, that also allowed us to send text messages or SMS. \n\nThan 3G, or the 3rd Generation technology era, began and introduced a faster and more effective way to transmit information that could now handle thousands and millions of devices worldwide and give us access to the internet through our mobile phones, which was revolutionary.\n\nWhat is 4G?\n4G, or 4th Generation technology, surpassed 3G by a very large margin. In theory, 4G is 100 times faster than 3G. It allows faster data transmission and can handle a far larger subscriber base. \n\nWhat advantages did it introduce? It enabled us to watch high-definition mobile TV, faster and more effective video communications, etc. It\u2019s the most commonly used type of communication network in the world, as most calls, texts, information transfers, and video calls are performed through 4G service. Soon enough, it will entirely phase out 3G, which can\u2019t really stand the competition anymore. \n\nWhat is LTE?\nLTE is something that sends people into a tailspin just because consumers can rarely differentiate between 4G and LTE services. And no wonder. LTE actually stands for Long-Term Evolution, and it was sort of a marketing trick to put 4G in front of it in order to make it more recognizable for the consumer. It is a big improvement on 3G, but not quite as good as true 4G. \n\nThe pool of potential devices that need access to mobile services expands very rapidly, not to mention the expansion of the internet itself, so there\u2019s a need for new technology to handle that amount of data successfully. That\u2019s where 5G starts to sound very promising. \n\nWhat is 5G?\nThere\u2019s much speculation, and frankly, controversy lately around the 5G technology, so let\u2019s clear the air, and hopefully answer some question you might be having about it. \n\nFirst of all, 5G is going to be way faster than any connection we\u2019ve experienced before. And by \u2018faster,\u2019 we mean streaming 4K quality videos without buffering. If downloading files took minutes with 4G, it would take a few seconds with 5G. So, in short, 5G is 5th Generation technology that can handle significantly more devices (around 24 billion expected in 2025), transmit much more data much faster than before, and bring us closer to the possibility of a new technological revolution. \n\nWhat is the Difference Between 3G and 4G?\nWe have brushed over the difference already, but let\u2019s be more specific:\n\nSpeed: 4G is a vast improvement on 3G speed-wise. 3G can manage a transmission speed of 8Mbps, while 4G allows 50Mbps with the potential to get to 100Mbps. \nTransmission: 4G allows you to transmit vast volumes of video information, which 3G does not, and introduces the possibility for high-definition mobile TV. \""}

Here is the original version of the story.\n\nSo this happened to my friend and I almost 2 decades ago but I'm only realizing the severity of it now that I remembered it.\n\nWe were like 10 (her) and 12 (me). Both girls. We snuck out in the middle of the night on a sleepover because we had a dumb urge to get some cola. And during that time the only store that was working nights was a small liquor store 30 minute walk away from where our house was. It was next to a train station, which was a sketch place overall full with drunks and the like. But us being so young we didn't know that and we just went.\n\nThe walk to the place was fine, quiet, as midnights are in a small town. But shortly after we started walking back, we noticed a car going by. The only car at that time, so we took notice. At first we didn't think much of it, but then we noticed it drove past us again. And a couple minutes later again. So we got alert and started walking faster. We were walking on the main street, which was pretty lit, so I assume now that the only reason nothing happened was because the person driving wanted to get us in a darker place. He took a turn towards a darker street once, trying to get ahead of us, but as we walked past it he drove out of it and started following us.\n\nThe moment we reached the street where we had to turn to our house, we took a sidewalk shortcut and we RAN. The shortcut didn't allow the car to drive after us straight away, and instead he had to drive slightly straight, then right, then right again into our street. And lucky the shortcut existed because at that time the street had no light. Absolutely none. But we noticed the car did actually start turning to our street and that's how we confirmed it was actually following us. Good thing the house was very closeby the time he turned to our street so he couldn't drive to us fast enough. But my God, when I think of it now I'm even more frighted than I was then because I know what could have happened since I understand it more. We could have been kidnapped, or molested, or even killed. Who knows.\n\nAt that time my friend and I forgot about the situation the very next day because we didn't realize what could have been. I wish I was smart enough back then to have remembered the plate numbers or anything. I hope that person didn't hurt anyone in that town. I now feel lucky nothing happened to us and my hometown is now in a completely different light for me since the realization."}

{"prompt": "Can you make this summary of the Japanese horror film \"Ring\" more concise? Try summarizing it in two paragraphs or less.\n\nDuring a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a videotape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. Presently, the phone rings, but it turns out to merely be Tomoko's mother. After Masami goes to the toilet, Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is later killed by an unseen presence.\n\nTomoko\u2019s aunt, journalist Reiko Asakawa, investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko\u2019s funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as hers. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked videotape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.\n\nTaking the threat of death seriously, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ry\u016bji Takayama. Ry\u016bji watches the tape despite Reiko\u2019s concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an \u014cshima dialect. Before departing to Oshima for further investigation, Reiko catches her and Ry\u016bji\u2019s six-year-old son Y\u014dichi watching the tape after being told to do so by \u2018Tomoko\u2019. In \u014cshima, Reiko and Ry\u016bji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by ESP researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko\u2019s brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko\u2019s young daughter Sadako psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko\u2019s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ry\u016bji never received a phone call after watching the tape because he didn't watch it at the cabin in Izu. The pair rush there to investigate, arriving there in the afternoon.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji find a well sealed in the cabin's crawlspace, which they deduce is the same well from the videotape's ending. Through another vision, they learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into the well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape 'recorded' the rage she had projected through nensha. After draining the water, they find Sadako\u2019s remains and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.\n\nThe next day, Ry\u016bji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the videotape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ry\u016bji at the time, hears his last minutes over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ry\u016bji did not. Desperate to save Y\u014dichi, Reiko drives to her father\u2019s home with the tape and asks him to do her \"a favour\"."}

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and moderate Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said Monday they would not support Raskin\u2019s nomination, all but dooming her chances of confirmation. Raskin\u2019s withdrawal was first reported by the New Yorker.\n\nRaskin, a former Fed governor and deputy Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, had been confirmed twice before for those posts with no opposition from Republicans. But she faced blowback this time from GOP lawmakers and Manchin over her calls for regulators to more closely scrutinize bank lending to oil and gas companies and help mitigate climate-related risks to the financial system.\n\n\u201cTheir point of contention was my frank public discussion of climate change and the economic costs associated with it,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Biden, according to the New Yorker. \u201cIt was \u2013 and is \u2013 my considered view that the perils of climate change must be added to the list of serious risks that the Federal Reserve considers as it works to ensure the stability and resiliency of our economy and financial system.\u201d\n\nWhile the financial industry raised no public objections to Raskin\u2019s nomination, Republicans such as Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania expressed fear that she might pursue measures that would make it more expensive for banks to lend to oil companies. She once wrote that regulators should \u201cask themselves how their existing instruments can be used to incentivize a rapid, orderly, and just transition away from high-emission and biodiversity-destroying investments.\u201d"}

Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially when part of an outdoor festival.\n\nSalsa's tempo ranges from about 150 bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm.[4] The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to salsa dancing and ensures that it takes eight beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps."}

During his lifetime, he was also known as \"the Young Pretender\" and \"the Young Chevalier\"; in popular memory, he is known as Bonnie Prince Charlie. He is best remembered for his role in the 1745 rising; his defeat at Culloden in April 1746 effectively ended the Stuart cause, and subsequent attempts failed to materialise, such as a planned French invasion in 1759.[2] His escape from Scotland after the uprising led to his portrayal as a romantic figure of heroic failure."}

While Neff says self-esteem comes from believing we are better than others, self-compassion directs us to love ourselves simply as we are. Self-compassion was shown in one study to help improve body dissatisfaction and motivate people to continue self-improvement efforts. Neff says self-compassion can be as simple as changing the language we use with ourselves. For example, if you went ahead and ate that damn cookie, don't beat yourself up for it. Instead of thinking how terrible you are for eating the cookie, remind yourself that you'll do better tomorrow.\n\n\"Exercise is as much a physical training as mental,\" says Sassy Gregson-Williams, founder of Naturally Sassy, a Global Online Workout Studio, Recipe Platform and App. \"These patterns are so ingrained in us, we want instantaneous results, and if we stray from that narrow unattainable path we set for ourselves we feel defeated.

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "Could you extract the poem for the following story? Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[192] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical\u2014written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.[193][194]\n\n\nPity by William Blake, 1795, Tate Britain, is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth:\n\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\"[195]\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[196][197] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[198] By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[199] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[200]\n\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly\u2014\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it\u2014let us know\nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...\n\n\u2014 Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, 4\u20138[200]\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".[201] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[202] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35\u201338); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21\u201325). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[202] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[203]\n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[204] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[205] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[206] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre."}

Compare that with the average inflation rate of just 1.4 percent two years ago. What happened? Prices have soared in the past year or so because of an economy flush with cash, surging consumer demand and COVID-related bottlenecks in the supply chain.\n\nAs most consumers know, food and energy costs have skyrocketed. But last month\u2019s numbers show that core inflation, which strips out those two volatile categories, climbed 6 percent on its own.\n\nConsumers certainly have been feeling the pinch. According to a nationally representative survey by Consumer Reports (PDF) of more than 2,000 U.S. adults in October, some 92 percent say they have seen higher prices when shopping for gas, with more than 6 out of 10 saying the increases were \u201clarge.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 percent of those shopping for groceries say prices have gone up, with 53 percent reporting \u201clarge\u201d increases.\n\nFor shoppers, these larger price tags require more planning, and perhaps a budget overhaul.\n\n\u201cMaintaining a cash reserve can be helpful if larger bills or unexpected expenses come in,\u201d says Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York City. \u201cKeeping track of your cash flow is helpful in navigating any financial environment.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "I'm too lazy to read this whole article. Can you give me the gist of why fast food prices are rising? 'What's happening: An order at Chipotle (CMG) costs about 10% more than it did one year ago, the restaurant chain said when reporting earnings on Tuesday. That means that if a steak burrito cost $8 this time in 2021, it's now $8.80.\nIt's not the only fast food option to get more expensive. McDonald's (MCD) increased its menu prices by about 6% last year, while Starbucks (SBUX) hiked prices in October and again in January.\nSo far, that hasn't hit sales. Chipotle reported revenue of $2 billion for the final three months of 2021, beating expectations. Comparable restaurant sales climbed more than 15%. Shares of the company are up 6.5% in premarket trading.\n\n\"We're pretty fortunate with the pricing power that we have,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in an interview with CNBC. \"Our brand is really strong.\" He noted a chicken burrito is still less than $8 in most US markets.\nEating out has been a significant component of surging inflation. Food away from home got about 6% more expensive last year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nDriving the increase: Companies like Chipotle have had to pay workers a lot more to combat staff shortages. In May, the company increased the pay of its restaurant workers to an average of $15 per hour. Ingredients and transporting goods have also become more expensive.\nThese factors aren't expected to dissipate any time soon. Food commodity prices have jumped 6% so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs. And workers continue to be in the driver's seat as demand for labor stays high.\n\"We continue to see pressure on wages,\" Niccol said on a call with analysts. \"We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front.\"\nWith this in mind, restaurant executives are telling Wall Street they expect price hikes to continue.\nStarbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts last week that the company has \"additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year\" in order to \"mitigate cost pressures.\"\nNiccol also indicated additional price rises are on the table at Chipotle.\n\"Beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated, if we don't see it abate, we'll have to take some additional pricing there,\" he said.\nChipotle's chief financial officer said they \"keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down,\" but \"it just hasn't happened yet.\"\nOn the radar: The latest data on US consumer inflation arrives tomorrow. Climbing food prices \u2014 both inside and out of the home \u2014 are likely to be a big part of the story.\nAnd while economists expect inflation to decline in the second half of the year, as central banks pull back support for the economy, executives in the restaurant industry don't sound like they're expecting much to change, at least for the time being.'"}

The Texans and Browns pulled off one of the biggest trades in NFL history on Friday with Houston sending Deshaun Watson to Cleveland in exchange for a hoard of draft picks. \n\nWhen the deal was officially announced by the Texans on Saturday, it appeared that they were going to walk away from the trade with five new draft picks, including three first-rounders. As it turns out though, the Browns actually ended up sweetening the pot for the Texans before the trade was officially finalized with the NFL on Monday. \n\nThe two sides ended up making some last second changes to the trade and the changes definitely ended up benefiting the Texans. Under the new -- and finalized -- terms of the deal, here's how things will break down (The changes are in bold): \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), two fourth-round picks (2022, 2024). \nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 sixth-round pick\nHere's what the old terms of the deal looked like as announced by the Texans on Friday: \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), one fourth-round pick (2024)\nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 fifth-round pick\nThe finalized deal has two big changes. First, the Browns will now be including an extra draft pick in the deal. Instead of sending one future fourth-round pick, the Browns are sending two of those to Houston with the Texans now getting a 2022 fourth-rounder to add to the 2024 fourth-rounder that was already included in the trade."}

Can you summarize it for me in 5 sentences?\n\nAfter two years of living with Covid-19, travelers are making big vacation plans again.\n\nBut not every type of trip may be available this year, travel professionals said.\n\nThat\u2019s because many people postponed more ambitious vacations during the pandemic \u2014 in some cases two years in a row \u2014 leaving little room for new bookings this year.\n\nNearly half of those who had vacations canceled in 2020 and 2021 plan to take them this year, according to a survey by travel insurance firm Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection. Only 5.5% are pushing these plans to next year, and less than 4% plan to cancel altogether, according to the survey of more than 1,500 travelers.\n\nIn addition, people are taking longer trips and booking them further in advance. Some fall and winter holidays are already beginning to sell out, said Lee Thompson, co-founder of adventure travel company, Flash Pack.\n\nBut some trips may be fully booked long before then, like these four types of vacations that travel insiders say are filling fast for the summer.\n\nAfrican safaris\nBooking an African safari 12 to 18 months in advance could be the new norm, said Shannon Kircher, founder of the U.S.-based boutique travel firm Compass & Vine.\n\nMany travelers dream about going on a safari, but don\u2019t pull the trigger because of the amount of planning and money that goes into it, said Kircher.\n\nHowever, the pandemic has \u201cchallenged our ideas of pushing off meaningful trips,\u201d she said. Plus, more people have the time and money to travel now, because of canceled trips from the past two years, she said.\n\nFor travelers easing back into the idea of international travel during the pandemic, the privacy and open-air nature of safaris are appealing, she said.\n\n\u201cSafaris are inherently socially distanced \u2014 you\u2019re around more animals than humans generally,\u201d she said.\n\nTravelers are choosing to visit East Africa from June through October as the period coincides with the great wildebeest migration, Kircher said, with many extending their trip to squeeze in a gorilla trekking experience or a post-safari beach escape.\n\nHawaii vacation home rentals\nMultiple locations in Hawaii are at risk of being without vacancies this summer, said Zander Buteux of home rental company VacationRenter.\n\n\u201cIf you wait until June to book for June travel, you will have slim pickings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially true for the key cities on each island such as Honolulu, Lahaina and Kihei.\u201d\n\nTwo areas that still have a good amount of availability are O\u2019ahu and Hanalei, said Buteux, though he doesn\u2019t expect things to stay this way.\n\nTravel to Hawaii has been on the rise for the past eight months, said Buteux. Business is expected to pick up even more \u2014 along with prices \u2014 once the state lifts many of its pandemic travel restrictions this month, he said. Starting March 26, visitors from the continental United States will no longer be required to show their Covid-19 vaccination status or a negative pre-travel Covid-19 test to enter.\n\nSummer isn\u2019t the only time of year that\u2019s being booked up fast, said Phil Jones, CEO of the luxury vacation home Pure Kauai. Easter and Christmas periods are also filling up, he said.  \n\nLike Buteux, he said: Once \u201cquarantine restrictions have been lifted, we predict a surge in bookings.\u201d\n\nLuxury dude ranches\nAmericans who are still hesitant about international travel are booking luxurious off-the-grid vacation spots in the country, said Kircher.\n\nSome well-known ranches are booked more than a year in advance, she said.\n\nThe Ranch at Rock Creek in Montana is mostly booked until February 2023, and almost all weekend slots at Wyoming\u2019s Brush Creek Ranch are full, according to their online reservation systems.\n\n\u201cFor most people, the privacy and disconnected nature of dude ranches are appealing,\u201d Kircher said. Activities such as horseback riding, fly fishing and white water rafting are outdoors and naturally socially distanced.\n\nPlus, visitors also get many of their needs taken care of as \u201cmost of the high-end lodges are really all-inclusive, meaning food, drinks, and luxury amenities are included,\u201d she said.\n\nPrivate yacht charters\nBooking last-minute summer yacht charters is a thing of the past, said Tim Geisler, founder of Grenada-based sailing company, Nautilus Sailing.\n\nMany destinations, especially in the Mediterranean, are selling out well ahead of time, he said.\n\nGreece, Spain and the French island of Corsica are the most popular charter destinations in the Mediterranean now, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are noticing that things are starting to return to almost pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said Geisler, adding that \u201c80% of our charters are already booked out in Spain.\u201d\n\nSummer yachting trips to the Mediterranean are popular among Americans because they tend to avoid the Caribbean during this time, as it coincides with the area\u2019s hurricane season, he said.\n\nThe company is seeing an increase in bookings and inquiries from travelers who want to book trips nine to 12 months ahead of time, which limits inventory down the line, he said.\n\n\u201cThe later you make a reservation, the less choice you will have when it comes to yacht size, configuration and location, therefore it\u2019s best to book [at least] six months in advance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company recently started operating in Croatia, said Geisler, adding that there is yacht availability there for the summer, but likely not for long.\n\nThe global yacht charter market, which was valued at $16.9 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $26.5 billion by 2027, with Europe being the top go-to destination in the summer months, according to the market research firm Mordor Intelligence."}

Can you summarize it for me in 5 sentences?\n\nAfter two years of living with Covid-19, travelers are making big vacation plans again.\n\nBut not every type of trip may be available this year, travel professionals said.\n\nThat\u2019s because many people postponed more ambitious vacations during the pandemic \u2014 in some cases two years in a row \u2014 leaving little room for new bookings this year.\n\nNearly half of those who had vacations canceled in 2020 and 2021 plan to take them this year, according to a survey by travel insurance firm Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection. Only 5.5% are pushing these plans to next year, and less than 4% plan to cancel altogether, according to the survey of more than 1,500 travelers.\n\nIn addition, people are taking longer trips and booking them further in advance. Some fall and winter holidays are already beginning to sell out, said Lee Thompson, co-founder of adventure travel company, Flash Pack.\n\nBut some trips may be fully booked long before then, like these four types of vacations that travel insiders say are filling fast for the summer.\n\nAfrican safaris\nBooking an African safari 12 to 18 months in advance could be the new norm, said Shannon Kircher, founder of the U.S.-based boutique travel firm Compass & Vine.\n\nMany travelers dream about going on a safari, but don\u2019t pull the trigger because of the amount of planning and money that goes into it, said Kircher.\n\nHowever, the pandemic has \u201cchallenged our ideas of pushing off meaningful trips,\u201d she said.

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nCarlota Guerrero: the Spanish photographer reframing the female body\nGuerrero has had a meteoric rise since capturing Solange\u2019s album cover in 2016. A new book charts her work to date, exploring her desire to carve out a space of liberation for her female subjects\n\nPhotographer Carlota Guerrero has a vivid memory from her early childhood. In the introduction of her new photobook, she recalls \u201csitting at my desk during school, fantasizing about climbing up on the teacher\u2019s table and taking off my clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers try to stop me, but I flee and run naked like a gazelle, through the corridors, the courtyard of the school and the gymnasium, and through all the public spaces. I feel terribly guilty for having imagined it.\u201d\n\nThis fantasy of escape and liberation remains the central thread of her photography. The self-taught photographer, who is from Barcelona, has been exploring these themes of femininity, body autonomy and exploration for a decade. After being gifted an Olga film camera as a teenager, she started out capturing her friend group\u2019s blissful, naked afternoons by the Mediterranean, and the freedom they felt in each other\u2019s company.\n\nShe credits an LSD trip for furthering this idea of female interconnectedness. \u201cWhen I bring women together in one place and photograph them, I am creating new organisms... as if each woman were an organ or a cell that, by joining the others, makes up a whole being,\u201d she writes.\n\nShe was in her mid-20s when she got her big break. Musician Solange Knowles contacted the then-unknown photographer after seeing her work on Instagram. Guerrero captured the musician in her trademark soft earth tones, hair full of colourful clips to hold the waves of her hair in place, for the cover of her 2016 album Seat at the Table.\n\nIt was a meeting of minds \u2013 Knowles\u2019s wistful, dreamy vision which exposes the awkward hidden details of womanhood dovetailed perfectly with Guerrero\u2019s own offbeat exploration of sensuality and healing. Guerrero would go on to collaborate with Solange on music videos and shoot her next album cover, When I Get Home.\n\nSince her fruitful collaboration with Knowles, Guerrero has become one of the most in-demand photographers working today. She has photographed musicians Arca and Rosalia and the poet Rupi Kaur. She\u2019s worked with fashion royalty, from Helmut Lang to Dior to Philip Lim. During 2019\u2019s Miami Art Basel show, she caused a viral sensation with her performance piece \u201cLove Different\u201d, in partnership with Spanish brand Desigual. The performance ended in a writhing mass of 30 bodies which included Lourdes Leon, Madonna\u2019s daughter.\n\nHer work to date is now collected in Tengo un Dragon Dentro del Corazon: The Photographs of Carlota Guerrero, a new photobook from Prestel, showcasing her distinctive low-contrast tones, seen with a warm and tranquil eye. Guerrero has said in interviews that her aesthetic vision stands in contrast with her own restless, anxious personality. She is also constantly working to see women\u2019s bodies in a different way, from a point of view of joy and camaraderie free from the male gaze.\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, Rupi Kaur recalls a shoot with Guerrero in which she \u201cended up naked in a bed of pink rose petals at her Barcelona studio.\u201d She points out that Guerrero\u2019s fixation on the female body is an attempt to reframe and reclaim them in popular visual culture. It goes beyond representation, even though the women she photographs vary in shape, size and skin tone. Although they tap into a raw sensuality, they are a million miles away from the women offered up for consumption in the pages of magazines Guerrero and her generation grew up seeing.\n\n\u201cCarlota\u2019s work is the antidote to our male-gaze problem,\u201d Kaur writes. \u201cIn an industry dominated by men shooting women\u2019s bodies, Carlota\u2019s vision is refreshing. As a woman, I\u2019m not interested in looking at my body through the eyes of a man anymore. I\u2019ve done that my whole life. I want to see and be shot by a woman whose images are celebrative, not exploitative. Sexy, not voyeuristic. In a world where the feminine is violated, the femininity that Carlota captures is honest and empowering.\u201d"}

Patterson is taking an order system that exists within the world and applies it to another set of subjects. In this case he switched the names from the stations with names from famous people. Each Line is a different group of people, like actors, philosophers, footballers etc. An edition was purchased by Charles Saatchi and shown in the Sensation exhibition of 1997 which toured London, Berlin and New York. An edition is in the Tate Gallery collection and is currently on display at Tate Britain in London.\n\nPatterson has also created large scale projects such as Cosmic Wallpaper at the University of Warwick, a Wilfred Owen tribute (Maison Foresti\u00e8re), and he also participated in the MoMA's \"The Project Series, 70, Banners I\".

{"prompt": "Parse the following text and tell me how the AI will be defined as aligned - Contemporary AI models can be difficult to understand, predict, and control. These problems can lead to significant harms when AI systems are deployed, and might produce truly devastating results if future systems are even more powerful and more widely used, and interact with each other and the world in presently unforeseeable ways.\n\nThis paper shares some nascent work towards one of our primary, ongoing goals, which is to align general-purpose AI systems with human preferences and values. A great deal of ink has been spilled trying to define what it means for AI systems to be aligned, and to guess at how this might go wrong. We will define an AI as \u201caligned\u201d if it is, in three words, helpful, honest, and harmless or \u2018HHH\u2019. Our alignment efforts aim to measure and address this general problem with large language models.\n\nMany researchers and organizations share this goal, but few have pursued it directly. Most research efforts associated with alignment either only pertain to very specialized systems, involve testing a specific alignment technique on a sub-problem, or are rather speculative and theoretical. Our view is that if it\u2019s possible to try to address a problem directly, then one needs a good excuse for not doing so. Historically we had such an excuse: general purpose, highly capable AIs were not available for investigation. But given the broad capabilities of large language models, we think it\u2019s time to tackle alignment directly, and that a research program focused on this goal may have the greatest chance for impact."}

{"prompt": "The title of this article is titled \"The Food at Subway isn't what you think it is\" What does the article actually say about it? \"Despite some recent struggles, Subway remains a giant in the fast food world. With nearly 24,000 locations, it is the largest restaurant chain in the country, and it brings in billions of dollars in revenue each year. But with great power comes great responsibility, and Subway has not always lived up to its end of the bargain. In particular, the chain hasn't always delivered to its customers the food they think they are getting.\n\nNearly every aspect of a Subway sandwich \u2014 the meat, the vegetables, and even the bread \u2014 has come under scrutiny for not being what the restaurant claims it to be. In some instances, the company has acknowledged its faults and corrected the problem. Other times, Subway has been defiant and pushed back against accusations. So whether it's getting cheated out of an extra inch of sandwich, eating bread filled with unpronounceable ingredients, or devouring tuna that might not actually be tuna, here are a few examples of food at Subway that isn't really what you think it is. Subway is no stranger to the accusation that it serves mystery meat. Not too long ago, a Canadian news outlet conducted DNA analysis on the sandwich maker's chicken to find that the meat was, in fact, only 50 percent chicken. Subway's latest protein controversy centers on the chicken of the sea. A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Subway's tuna is not tuna at all. The lawsuit states that the ingredient is \"a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a restaurant passed off one fish for another. But the most troubling part of this new allegation is the claim that what Subway is calling \"tuna\" isn't a cheaper fish substitute. Speaking with The Washington Post, an attorney for the plaintiffs claimed lab tests showed the ingredients were \"not fish,\" declining to say what precisely what they found to be were. This makes one former employee's claim that the tuna salad was one bag of tuna and three bags of mayonnaise look like an upgrade.\n\nSubway denied the allegations, but the plaintiffs are still suing for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and other claims, arguing they \"were tricked into buying food items that wholly lacked the ingredients they reasonably thought they were purchasing.\"\n\nOverseas, a court ruled Subway's bread didn't qualify as actual bread\n\nSubway received a particularly humbling piece of news in late 2020 when Ireland's Supreme Court ruled that the restaurant's bread was, believe it or not, not actually bread \u2013 at least in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe problem, according to the court, is the amount of sugar Subway includes in its bread recipe. Ireland's Value-Added Tax Act allows \"staple\" foods, including bread, to be exempt from certain taxes. But the law only allows bread's sugar to be a maximum of 2 percent of the weight of flour, otherwise it's more of a pastry. Not only does Subway's bread recipe have more than the allotted sugar amount, it has five times more.\n\nThe case was brought to the court by an Irish franchisee who was hoping to get a tax refund. It clearly did not work out in their favor. The franchisor was none too pleased either, pushing back against the ruling \u2014 without arguing the court's reasoning. They issued a statement, saying \"Subway's bread is, of course, bread. We have been baking fresh bread in our restaurants for more than three decades and our guests return each day for sandwiches made on bread that smells as good as it tastes.\"\n\nSubway's food is not as healthy as it seems\n\nSubway was able to establish itself as one of the quick-service restaurant giants by promoting itself as the healthier alternative to traditional fast food. But the healthy reputation isn't entirely accurate.\n\nIn general, Subway does offer a wider array of healthier options than the average burger joint. But you need to be careful what you order, and what you're adding on to that order. Although many sandwiches are low in things like sugar, they often have bloated fat and sodium levels. And the restaurant does its best to hide this, as one former employee explained. \"When you walk into a Subway store, you'll see all of our menus have the calories listed with each sandwich ... What you can't read is the small print on the menu, which specifies that these values are only for a six-inch sub, on 'standard recipe' (nobody knows what the [heck] that is) white bread, with no cheese or sauce.\"\n\nTherefore, you can easily be tricked into thinking you're getting a low-fat, low-calorie sandwich. But if you're ordering a foot-long sandwich with cheese and sauce (which 99 percent of the customers do, according to the employee), you're roughly tripling those numbers.\""}

{"prompt": "What paradox is this Wikipedia article referring to?\n\nIt is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:\nBut I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.[2]\n\nViktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning:\nHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\n\nThe more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.[3]\n\nPhilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901):\nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.\nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power increases\u2014that a resistance is overcome.[4]\n\n[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)[5]\n\nPsychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):\nNietzsche's \"will to power\" and \"will to seem\" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of F\u00e9r\u00e9 and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.[6]\n\nPoet and satirist Edward Young:\nThe love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,\nReigns more or less supreme in every heart;\nThe Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;\nThe modest shun it, but to make it sure![7]\n\nPolitician William Bennett:\nHappiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.[8][9]\n\nNovelist Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa:\nHappiness is found only in little moments of inattention."}

{"prompt": "A potential new COVID-19 variant, a combination of the delta and omicron variants \u2013 you can call it \"deltacron\" \u2013 has been identified.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Wednesday that the new COVID-19 combination has been detected in France, the Netherlands and Denmark. It's also been found in the U.S., according to a new report soon to be published on research site MedRxiv, and viewed by USA TODAY.\n\nThe San Mateo, California-headquartered lab Helix, which works with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track COVID-19, sequenced 29,719 positive COVID-19 samples collected Nov. 22 to Feb. 13 from across the U.S., according to the research team, which included the University of Washington Medical Center and testing company Thermo Fisher Scientific.\n\nResearchers found two infections involving different versions of deltacron, resulting from the combination of delta and omicron genetic material. Twenty other infections had both the delta and omicron variants, with one case having delta, omicron and Deltacron.\n\nUS COVID-19 map: Tracking cases and deaths\n\nAlcohol and the brain: Just one beer or glass of wine a day may cause your brain to shrink, study suggests\n\nShould we worry about deltacron?\nExperts say it's too soon to worry about deltacron. Compared with earlier variants, such as delta and omicron, this new variation \u2013 researchers have not adopted the \"deltacron\" name officially \u2013 appears unlikely to spread as easily, said William Lee, the chief science officer at Helix.\n\n\"The fact that there is not that much of it, that even the two cases we saw were different, suggests that it's probably not going to elevate to a variant of concern level\" and warrant its own Greek letter name, Lee told USA TODAY.\n\nSo far, in the places where deltacron has been detected, \"there are very low levels of this detection,\" said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an American infectious disease epidemiologist and the WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, during a Wednesday press conference.\n\nFor now, WHO has not seen \"any change in the epidemiology,\" Van Kerkhove said. And regarding deltacron, \"we haven't seen any change in severity. But there are many studies that are underway.\"\n\nWilliam Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, concurs.\n\n\"It's only a variant if it produces a large number of cases,\" he said. \"So no, if it's not causing lots of cases, people don\u2019t need to be concerned.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nHow do we get COVID-19 variants?\nViruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 strain that causes COVID-19 can change and mutate. For instance, the mutations that caused the delta variant resulted in a variant that made people contagious sooner. The omicron variant itself was more contagious and was found to reinfect some who had previously had COVID-19.  Can you summarize this into 2 bullet points please?"}

LONDON \u2014 Seventy years ago this weekend, a young English princess climbed into Treetops, a remote game-viewing lodge in Kenya, built into the limbs of a fig tree overlooking an elephant watering hole. The next morning, she came down as a queen, though she only learned of the death of her father, George VI, later that day.\n\nThe 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s accession to the throne will be a good deal more earthbound: The 95-year-old monarch plans to spend a quiet Sunday at her country estate, Sandringham, where her father died on Feb. 6, 1952. Four days of festivities to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee are scheduled for June.\n\nBut tributes to the queen poured in from Britain\u2019s great, good and merely prominent. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, told the BBC, \u201cShe takes her duties seriously, but she doesn\u2019t take herself very seriously.\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised her for her \u201cinspirational sense of duty and unwavering dedication to this nation.\u201d\n\nThose words, from a scandal-scarred leader whose tenure in office might be measured in days rather than decades, were testimony not only to the queen\u2019s longevity but also to her immutability. In a country that lurched from the storms of Brexit into the siege of the pandemic, she has been an unmatched anchor of stability."}

Possibly one of the best popular music documentaries of our time. \"Get Back\" chronicles the January 1969 Beatles \"Let It Be\" project from start to finish, including the creativity, fun, crisis, and uncertainty about what the project was actually going to be about. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings/Hobbit) does a remarkable job taking us on this often bumpy journey. His 6-hour rockumentary shows The Beatles emerging triumphant by the end - giving a free concert for the whole of the London Business District from the rooftop of their Apple building at 3 Saville Row. The main takeaway is - these four guys genuinely loved and respected each other. Their interpersonal relationships, when seen through Jackon's lens, are far more positive than the previous negativity put forth in the heavily-edited Let It Be film (United Artists 1970). \"Get Back\" is highly recommended for any Beatles fan...or anyone who wants to take an in-depth journey back to the late 1960's and get a rare glimpse at their creative process.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this wikipedia page on 50 cent? I just want to know what it says about him getting shot. \"Jackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals.[25] In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records.[26][27] Jackson's first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks,[18] and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album.[12] In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks;[11] eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar.[28] Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.[29][30]\n\nJackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio.[23][31] The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: \"There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant\".[23] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track,[31] and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour.[32] Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.[33]\n\nOn May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard.[citation needed] Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek.[12][20][34] His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice;[20][32][35] his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard,[36] was killed three weeks later.[37]\n\nJackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'\"[20] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone\".[15] Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.[12][20][38]\n\nIn the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada.[39][40] With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\"[41] Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\""}
{"prompt": "What paradox is this Wikipedia article referring to?\n\nIt is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:\nBut I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.[2]\n\nViktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning:\nHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\n\nThe more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.[3]\n\nPhilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901):\nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.\nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power increases\u2014that a resistance is overcome.[4]\n\n[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)[5]\n\nPsychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):\nNietzsche's \"will to power\" and \"will to seem\" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of F\u00e9r\u00e9 and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.[6]\n\nPoet and satirist Edward Young:\nThe love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,\nReigns more or less supreme in every heart;\nThe Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;\nThe modest shun it, but to make it sure![7]\n\nPolitician William Bennett:\nHappiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.[8][9]\n\nNovelist Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa:\nHappiness is found only in little moments of inattention."}

His first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician \u201canalyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal\u201d.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as \u201cmysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition\u201d.\n\nCombined with nearly 150 \u201ccarefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs\u201d, the collection \u201cresembles an epic poem\u201d, said S&S.\n\nJonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: \u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.\u201d\n\nDylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016.

His legal team have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit \u201ca brazen shakedown ... false, malicious, reckless and defamatory\u201d.\n\nThe Philosophy of Modern Song is published on 8 November , with an accompanying audiobook partially narrated by Dylan."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me in 3 paragraphs or less?\n\nGov. Spencer Cox announced Friday Utah is on track to start treating COVID-19 like the flu or other seasonal respiratory diseases by March 31, stopping just short of declaring the pandemic is over in the state after more than two years.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear that this is not the end of COVID,\u201d the governor said during a news conference at the state Capitol in Salt Lake City outlining the Utah Department of Health\u2019s plans to discontinue testing for all but the most vulnerable Utahns as well as daily reports on the spread of the virus.\n\nThe changes don\u2019t mean that Utah is \u201cspiking the football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the state, we are not packing up and heading home. We will continue to see cases and outbreaks and hospitalizations and, unfortunately, deaths. But it does mean we are adapting to how we respond to these things. There is still work to be done,\u201d Cox said.\n\nOver the next six weeks, he said the virus testing and treatment now provided by the state health department will shift to private health care systems. COVID-19 vaccinations and monitoring will continue to be handled by the public health agency, and testing and other supplies will be stockpiled in case of a future outbreak.\nIt\u2019s a transition from \u201can emergency posture and into a manageable risk model,\u201d where it\u2019s up to Utahns to decide for themselves whether they need to wear a mask, social distance or get vaccinated, the governor said, suggesting that for some at least, it\u2019s time to be more relaxed.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole bunch of people who are unvaccinated and unboosted and at high risk who should take this disease much more seriously. There are also a whole bunch of people in our state who are vaccinated and boosted and young and at low risk who could stand to take this disease a lot less seriously,\u201d Cox said.\n\nBoth Intermountain Healthcare, the region\u2019s largest health care provider, and University of Utah Health, the only academic health care system in the mountain west, issued statements after the governor\u2019s announcement stressing the need for Utahns to keep taking precautions against the virus.\n\n\u201cIntermountain Healthcare strongly encourages Utahns to continue to employ good preventive practices, including masking in public, avoiding large gatherings, and getting vaccinated or boosted to combat the transmission and severe health impacts of COVID,\u201d Intermountain Healthcare spokesman Jess Gomez said.\n\nU. Health spokeswoman Kathy Wilets said, \u201cThough cases are declining, COVID-19 continues to strain our resources as a hospital system. We ask the public to continue to mask, vaccinate, and practice social distancing as we work vigilantly to provide care to our community.\u201d\nLt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said the administration will continue to encourage Utahns to get vaccinated against COVID-19, including children as young as 6 months old once they become eligible for the shots. Federal authorities have delayed the approval process until a study of a third dose is completed, likely in April.\n\n\u201cVaccines have saved a lot of lives, and they\u2019ve prevented so much spread,\u201d Henderson said, despite breakthrough cases like her recent second bout with COVID-19 that kept her home for weeks. Thanks to being vaccinated, she did not require hospitalization or ongoing supplemental oxygen this time, unlike her first case in 2020.\n\nVaccinations prevent severe illness, the lieutenant governor said, but Utah \u201chas a long way to go\u201d when it comes to booster shots. Currently, less than 61% of all Utahns are fully vaccinated, meaning it\u2019s been two weeks or more since their final, initial dose, and just over 26% have also gotten a booster shot.\nThe science supports the move, Cox said, citing reliance on testing wastewater for the virus and other measures after he told most Utahns to skip testing if they show symptoms. Utah\u2019s case counts have dropped since a January surge fueled by the omicron variant, along with hospitalizations, but deaths remain high.\n\nFriday, the state health department reported 15 additional deaths from COVID-19, including two deaths that occurred before Jan. 18, bringing Utah\u2019s death toll from the virus to 4,359. There were also 999 new cases reported, and 459 people are currently hospitalized in Utah with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe know where this is going. We know what the trends are. And if it doesn\u2019t, we have the ability to adjust. This idea that we have to get stuck in some crazy situation forever is very, very unscientific,\u201d the Republican leader said, noting other states, including those led by Democrats, are taking similar actions.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at the news media, saying he is \u201cvery disappointed in the media members that continue to perpetuate that instead of understanding. We\u2019ve seen a huge change in the national media and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because blue governors are sounding like red governors now.\u201d\nUtahns are ready for what would be the endemic phase of COVID-19, he said. Unlike during a pandemic, when exponential spread of a disease encompasses the globe, a disease is considered endemic when outbreaks are more limited, even though hospitalizations and deaths continue.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re moving on to this new phase of the pandemic response, as we\u2019re moving away from a pandemic response, most Americans, most Utahns, are ready to be done with this,\u201d the governor said, urging Utahns to be respectful of those who continue to wear masks and take other precautions against the virus.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s \u201ca false question\u201d to ask about the impact of the new phase on the immunocompromised who depend on others to take precautions around them because they are more vulnerable to infection, along with others, including the elderly and children under 5 who cannot yet get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely false that if you\u2019re immunocompromised, you can\u2019t protect yourself from COVID-19, and that we have to have every single person in the world protect you from COVID-19. That was true a year ago. That is not true today,\u201d the governor said, given booster shots and new treatments.\n\nTwo of his siblings are \u201cseverely immunocompromised\u201d and one has regularly worn N95 masks for many years, Cox said, telling Utahns because \u201cwe care deeply about our immunocompromised individuals,\u201d they should not mock someone for wearing a mask.\n\n\u201cGive them your love and support,\u201d because it\u2019s very possible they\u2019re going through cancer treatment. It\u2019s very possible they live with someone who is severely immunocompromised. That\u2019s why we have to be kind and we have to be respectful of the choices people make,\u201d the governor said."}

The blood, bones, feathers and liver tissue of 1,210 eagles sampled from 2010 to 2018 were examined to assess chronic and acute lead exposure.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time for any wildlife species that we\u2019ve been able to evaluate lead exposure and population level consequences at a continental scale,\u201d said study co-author Todd Katzner, a wildlife biologist at U.S. Geological Survey in Boise, Idaho. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning that nearly 50% of them are getting repeatedly exposed to lead.\u201d\n\nLead is a neurotoxin that even in low doses impairs an eagle\u2019s balance and stamina, reducing its ability to fly, hunt and reproduce. In high doses, lead causes seizures, breathing difficulty and death.\n\nThe study estimated that lead exposure reduced the annual population growth of bald eagles by 4% and golden eagles by 1%.\n\nBald eagles are one of America\u2019s most celebrated conservation success stories, and the birds were removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007.\n\nBut scientists say that high lead levels are still a concern. Besides suppressing eagle population growth, lead exposure reduces their resilience in facing future challenges, such as climate change or infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about recovery, it\u2019s not really the end of the story \u2014 there are still threats to bald eagles,\u201d said Krysten Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist at Cornell University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, who was not involved in the study.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrevious studies have shown high lead exposure in specific regions, but not across the country. The blood samples from live eagles in the new study were taken from birds trapped and studied for other reasons; the bone, feather and liver samples came from eagles killed by collisions with vehicles or powerlines, or other misfortunes.\n\n\u201cLead is present on the landscape and available to these birds more than we previously thought,\u201d said co-author Vince Slabe, a research wildlife biologist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Global. \u201cA lead fragment the size of the end of a pin is large enough to cause mortality in an eagle. \u201d\n\nThe researchers also found elevated levels of lead exposure in fall and winter, coinciding with hunting season in many states.\n\nDuring these months, eagles scavenge on carcasses and gut piles left by hunters, which are often riddled with shards of lead shot or bullet fragments.\n\nSlabe said the upshot of the research was not to disparage hunters. \u201cHunters are one of the best conservation groups in this country,\u201d he said, noting that fees and taxes paid by hunters help fund state wildlife agencies, and that he also hunted deer and elk in Montana.\n\nHowever, Slabe said he hopes the findings provide an opportunity to \u201ctalk to hunters about this issue in a clear manner\u201d and that more hunters will voluntarily switch to non-lead ammunition such as copper bullets.\n\nLead ammunition for waterfowl hunting was banned in 1991, due to concerns about contamination of waterways, and wildlife authorities encouraged the use of nontoxic steel shot. However, lead ammunition is still common for upland bird hunting and big game hunting.\n\nThe amount of lead exposure varies regionally, with highest levels found in the Central Flyway, the new study found.\n\nAt the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center, veterinarian and executive director Victoria Hall said that \u201c85 to 90% of the eagles that come into our hospital have some level of lead in their blood,\u201d and X-rays often show fragments of lead bullets in their stomachs.\n\nEagles with relatively low levels can be treated, she said, but those with high exposure can\u2019t be saved.\n\nLaura Hale, board president at nonprofit Badger Run Wildlife Rehab in Klamath County, Oregon, said she\u2019ll never forget the first eagle she encountered with acute lead poisoning, in 2018. She had answered a resident\u2019s call about an eagle that seemed immobile in underbrush and brought it to the clinic.\n\nThe young bald eagle was wrapped in a blanket, unable to breathe properly, let alone stand or fly.\n\n\u201cThere is something hideous when you watch an eagle struggling to breathe because of lead poisoning \u2013 it\u2019s really, really harsh,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. That eagle went into convulsions, and died within 48 hours.\n\nLead on the landscape affects not only eagles, but also many other birds \u2014 including hawks, vultures, ravens, swans and geese, said Jennifer Cedarleaf, avian director at Alaska Raptor Center, a nonprofit wildlife rescue in Sitka, Alaska.\n\nBecause eagles are very sensitive to lead, are so well-studied and attract so much public interest, \u201cbald eagles are like the canary in the coal mine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the species that tells us: We have a bit of problem.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this news article for me?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration is set to extend the federal public transportation mask mandate for another 30 days, an administration official told CNN, pointing to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mandate is one of the last remaining broad requirements that Americans wear masks in public places. It applies to mass transportation including planes, trains, buses and hubs like airports.\n\nThe official\u2019s comments came after CNN reported that federal officials began notifying stakeholders in the airline industry of the upcoming announcement. Three sources, including two industry officials and a government official, described the conversations to CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe requirement, which now extends to April 18, was previously set to expire a week from Friday, and the policy will be reviewed over the next month, the official said.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, CDC will work with government agencies to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis revised framework will be based on the Covid-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. We will communicate any updates publicly if and/or when they change.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that means the CDC may ultimately allow the mandate to lift before the 30-day period is up if transmission rates of the virus nationwide drop to low enough levels.\n\nThe federal announcement comes as many state and local mask mandates have been dropped or are set to be rescinded.\n\nIn the skies, requiring masks has proven to be a divisive issue. Flight crew unions applauded the measure for protecting flight attendants who can not avoid close contact with scores of passengers.\n\nBut some passengers refused, leading to more than 4,800 reports to the Federal Aviation Administration of passengers who turned disruptive or violent while flouting the mask rule. The agency adopted a zero-tolerance approach to in-flight outbursts, which surged during the pandemic.\n\nSome in the airline industry have described a concern about lifting the mandate too soon, ahead of another wave of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t want is to lift the mandate and have to reimpose it,\u201d one of the sources told CNN."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty."}

DeMar DeRozan's jumper gave Team LeBron a comfortable 161-155 lead, but his Chicago Bulls teammate, Zach LaVine, scored five straight points to pull Team Durant within 161-160.

{"prompt": "What did President Biden say about Putin in this article?\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal\" Wednesday, a rhetorical leap that came as civilian deaths mount in Ukraine.\n\nIt was the harshest condemnation of Putin's actions from any US official since the war in Ukraine began three weeks ago. Previously, Biden had stopped short of labeling atrocities being documented on the ground in Ukraine as \"war crimes,\" citing ongoing international and US investigations.\nBut on Wednesday, speaking with reporters at an unrelated event, Biden affixed the designation on the Russian leader.\n\"I think he is a war criminal,\" Biden said after remarks at the White House.\nThe shift from the administration's previous stance came after an emotional address to Congress from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who aired a video showing Ukrainians suffering amid Russia's onslaught. Zelensky asked American lawmakers and Biden for more help defending itself, including a no-fly zone and fighter jets.\nBiden responded in his own address a few hours later, laying out new American military assistance to Ukraine -- including anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, weapons and drones -- but stopping short of acceding to Zelensky's requests.\nStill, Biden acknowledged the horrors transpiring on the ground.\n\"We saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol,\" Biden said. \"These are atrocities. They're an outrage to the world. And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.\"\nIt wasn't until a few hours after that that Biden responded to a question about Putin being a war criminal. Biden initially said \"no,\" but immediately returned to a group of reporters to clarify what had been asked. When asked again whether Putin was a war criminal, he answered in the affirmative.\nOfficials, including Biden, had previously avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. Other world leaders have not been as circumspect, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said last week war crimes were being committed. The International Criminal Court at the Hague has also opened an investigation into war crimes. And the US Senate unanimously asked for an international investigation into war crimes on Tuesday. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people \"constitute war crimes,\" marking the first time a senior US official directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month's attack on Ukraine began.\nIn Poland last week, Vice President Kamala Harris called for international investigations into war crimes, and made clear she believed atrocities were underway. She said the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute war crimes.\nAfter Biden delivered his assessment, the White House said the administration's investigation into war crimes would continue.\n\"The President's remarks speak for themselves,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said Biden was \"speaking from the heart.\"\nWhile the term \"war crimes\" is often used colloquially -- as Biden appeared to be doing Wednesday -- they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Convention, which specifies intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime.\nYet in order to prosecute a war crime, solid evidence is required. And for Russian officials to be held accountable, they would need to travel outside of the country.\nStill, an official designation of war crimes -- backed up with evidence -- would still present the West with a symbolic tool in framing Putin's actions in Ukraine.\nBiden has come under increasing pressure to do more to help besieged Ukrainians as Russia's campaign intensifies. On Wednesday, a theater in Mariupol where civilians were sheltering was bombed, the latest example of Russia's indiscriminate shelling.\nThe pressure was only likely to increase after Zelensky's dramatic appeal to lawmakers for more help. He compared what is happening in Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and September 11, and said \"we need you right now\" to offer more support.\nBiden watched the address from the library of his private residence, and later called it a \"convincing\" and \"significant\" speech.\n\"Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals,\" he said afterward. \"I mean, it's godawful.\"\nNext week, Biden plans to travel to Brussels for an extraordinary session of NATO leaders, where he hopes to demonstrate western unity amid Russia's aggression."}

{"prompt": "This article is confusing me. Has Russia invaded Ukraine based according to it? \"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.\n\nIt is unclear if Russian troop movements marked the beginning of an invasion of Ukraine that Western leaders have warned about for weeks. But multiple US and Western officials warned Monday\u2019s move could serve as the opening salvo of a larger military operation targeting the country.\n\nIn a fiery speech on Monday night, Putin blasted Kyiv\u2019s growing security ties with the West, and in lengthy remarks about the history of the USSR and the formation of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, appeared to cast doubt on Ukraine\u2019s right to self-determination.\n\n\u201cUkraine has never had traditions of its own statehood,\u201d he said, calling the eastern part of the country \u201cancient Russian lands.\u201d\n\nThe decrees signed by Putin conveyed Moscow\u2019s official recognition over two breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine \u2013 the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (DPR and LPR). The decrees recognized them as independent states, and guaranteed their security with Russian troops. The decrees said that Russian so-called peacekeeping forces would be deployed in the regions. A senior US administration official said the speech was meant to \u201cjustify war\u201d to the Russian people and that it amounted to \u201can attack on the very idea of a sovereign and independent Ukraine\u201d using \u201ca number of false claims\u201d meant to justify military action.\n\n\u201cThe human costs of a further Russian invasion and occupation will be devastating,\u201d the official said.\n\nSeparatists in eastern Ukraine have long had substantial backing from the Kremlin, with the US, NATO and Ukrainian officials saying Moscow supplies them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks. Russia has always denied having its own troops on the ground.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years, with Putin attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens. Kyiv and the West maintain that the region is part of Ukrainian territory, although the Ukranian government asserts the two regions have been in effect Russian-occupied since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began.\n\nOn Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin\u2019s decision to recognize the breakaway regions \u201ca clear attack on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty\u201d and said US President Joe Biden would sign an executive order prohibiting \u201call new investment, trade and financing by US persons to, from, and in the so-called \u2018Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics.\u201d\n\nBiden said last month that \u201cif any assembled Russian units move across Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I\u2019ve discussed in detail with our allies, as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Monday, Putin held a highly choreographed televised meeting with his top officials, accusing Kyiv of carrying out acts of aggression.\n\nPutin also accused the West of threats and blackmail during the previously unscheduled convening of the Russian security council that, in unusually theatrical setting, was shown on television.\n\nThe broadcast aired just hours after the White House announced that US President Joe Biden agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to French-brokered talks with Putin as long as Russia does not further invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said earlier on Monday that there were \u201cno concrete plans\u201d for a meeting.\n\nSpeaking about the possibility of talks with Biden, Putin \u2013 who held two lengthy phone calls with the French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday \u2013 hinted he was skeptical. \u201cYesterday I spoke with the French President on two occasions, with the second call lasting until 2:00 a.m. or so. He assured me that the American position has changed somewhat. But when I asked what these changes are, he, unfortunately, could not say.\u201d Putin said.\n\nHe then referred to remarks made on Sunday by Blinken, who stressed once again that the issue of Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO is \u201can issue for Ukraine and for NATO.\u201d\n\nAssurances that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO in the future are one of the central demands made by the Kremlin.\n\nWith his top officials assembled in front of him at the extraordinary meeting of the security council, Putin appeared following claims made by the Russian military earlier on Monday that troops and border guards engaged in a clash with a \u201csabotage and reconnaissance group from the territory of Ukraine\u201d inside Russian territory.\n\n\u201cRussia has always tried to resolve all conflicts by peaceful means. Nevertheless, the Kyiv authorities conducted two punitive operations in these territories [Donetsk and Luhansk], and it seems that we are now witnessing an escalation for the third time,\u201d Putin said, without further elaborating or providing specifics.\n\nCNN has not independently verified reports of a clash inside Russia\u2019s territory. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba denied a clash occurred, saying on Twitter, \u201cI categorically refute the disinformation of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nKuleba said Ukraine \u201cdid not attack Donetsk, Luhansk, did not send saboteurs or armored personnel carriers across the border, did not fire on the territory of the Russian Federation or the checkpoint at the border, did not commit sabotage, does not plan such actions.\u201d The increase in combative language from Putin came as tensions grew once again in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Joint Forces Operation said it recorded 32 ceasefire violations as of 4 p.m. local time, a number that was roughly in line with those over the weekend.\n\nNew satellite images showed intensified activity among Russian units close to Ukraine\u2019s north-eastern border and the Ukrainian Defense ministry said it recorded dozens of ceasefire violations on Sunday.\n\nDefense minister Oleksii Reznikov said Monday that Ukraine was not seeing any withdrawal of Russian forces from positions close to the border.\n\nAnd in a further escalation, Belarusian officials announced Sunday that joint Russian military exercises in Belarus that were slated to end over the weekend would continue, implying that Russian forces may extend their stay\""}

The Texans and Browns pulled off one of the biggest trades in NFL history on Friday with Houston sending Deshaun Watson to Cleveland in exchange for a hoard of draft picks. \n\nWhen the deal was officially announced by the Texans on Saturday, it appeared that they were going to walk away from the trade with five new draft picks, including three first-rounders. As it turns out though, the Browns actually ended up sweetening the pot for the Texans before the trade was officially finalized with the NFL on Monday. \n\nThe two sides ended up making some last second changes to the trade and the changes definitely ended up benefiting the Texans. Under the new -- and finalized -- terms of the deal, here's how things will break down (The changes are in bold): \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), two fourth-round picks (2022, 2024). \nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 sixth-round pick\nHere's what the old terms of the deal looked like as announced by the Texans on Friday: \n\nTexans receive: Three first-round picks (2022, 2023, 2024), one third-round pick (2023), one fourth-round pick (2024)\nBrowns receive: Deshaun Watson, 2024 fifth-round pick\nThe finalized deal has two big changes. First, the Browns will now be including an extra draft pick in the deal. Instead of sending one future fourth-round pick, the Browns are sending two of those to Houston with the Texans now getting a 2022 fourth-rounder to add to the 2024 fourth-rounder that was already included in the trade."}

LDWF biologists and managers recommend shrimp seasons based on a shrimp species\u2019 annual life cycles and growth rates, which are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. LDWF biologists continually monitor shrimp populations and environmental conditions in Louisiana\u2019s marshes, coastal lakes, and bays. At hundreds of sample locations, they tow trawls through the water, count and identify the species they catch, measure a random selection of the shrimp catch, and record the data. They also record water conductivity, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels. They then compile the data and plug it into mathematical models. These models help biologists project when the majority of the shrimp population within each the state\u2019s major estuarine basins will reach market size. The Commission uses these projections to determine when and where to open and close the shrimp fishery. Adjusting seasons in response to the conditions that influence shrimp populations helps fishermen have more productive shrimping trips."}

At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.[13] The nation consists of the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

For The First Time, There Has Been an Unplanned Spacecraft Crash With The Moon\nAFP5 MARCH 2022\nAdd one more crater to the long list of pockmarks on the lunar surface.\n\nAccording to orbital calculations, a rocket hurtling through space for years crashed into the Moon on Friday, but the strike wasn't directly observed, and there might be a wait for photographic evidence.\n\nThe impact would have taken place at 7:25 am US Eastern Time (1225 GMT), on the far side of the Moon, said the astronomer Bill Gray, who was the first to predict the collision.\n\nRacing through the cosmos at around 5,800 mph (9,300 kph), the roughly four-ton object should make a crater \"10 or 20 meters across,\" Gray told AFP.\n\nIts speed, trajectory, and time of impact were calculated using Earth-based telescope observations.\n\n\"We had lots (and lots) of tracking data for the object, and there is nothing acting on it except the forces of gravity and sunlight,\" he said, with the latter pushing the cylinder gently away from the Sun.\n\n\"Unless the object was removed by an occult hand, it hit the Moon this morning.\"\n\nThe identification of the rocket has been a subject of debate since there is no official entity responsible for listing and tracking junk in deep space.\n\nGray, an independent contractor who has created orbital calculation software used by NASA, hunts for and monitors human-made debris, so that scientists do not confuse it for asteroids and study it unnecessarily.\n\nHe initially thought what he was seeing was a SpaceX rocket, but later changed his mind and said it was a third-stage booster of Chang'e 5-T1, launched in 2014 as part of the Chinese space agency's lunar exploration program.\n\nBeijing denied responsibility, saying the booster in question had \"safely entered the Earth's atmosphere and was completely incinerated\".\n\nBut according to Gray, the statement by China's foreign ministry conflated two missions with similar names and was actually talking about a rocket launched much later.\n\nWhatever the case, only NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and India's Chandrayaan-2, both of which orbit the Moon, will be able to image the crater.\n\nThe US space agency said in late January it wanted to survey the crater, but said that finding it would be a challenge that might take \"weeks to months.\"\n\nAccording to Gray, both probes are able to observe any region on the Moon once a month.\n\nIt's not unusual for rocket stages to be abandoned to the cosmos after serving their purpose of launching spacecraft.\n\nBut this would mark the first time an unintentional collision with the Moon has been projected.\n\nSpacecraft have been intentionally crashed into the Moon before for scientific purposes, such as during the Apollo missions to test seismometers."}

Please tell me what this article is about.U.N. body weighs a global treaty to fight plastic pollution.\n\nDelegates from United Nations member countries are considering proposals for a binding global treaty to curb plastic pollution.\n\nThe U.N. Environment Assembly, meeting Feb. 28 to March 2 in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, is expected to propose an international framework to address the growing plastic waste problem in the world\u2019s oceans, rivers, and landscape.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in history, we are seeing unprecedented global momentum to tackle the plague of plastic pollution,\u201d said U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen.\nDuring preparations for the session, Andersen implored member states to take the opportunity to reshape humanity\u2019s \u201crelationship with plastic once and for all\u201d by developing a comprehensive global agreement to combat the problem.\nTwo major proposals have emerged during years of international discussions about ways to reduce single use plastic.\nThe first, by Peru and Rwanda, calls for a full spectrum approach to plastic pollution, covering raw materials extraction, plastic production, as well as plastic use and disposal. It urges creation of \u201can international legally binding agreement ... to prevent and reduce plastic pollution in the environment, including micro plastics.\u201d\nThe proposal is co-sponsored by Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Norway, the Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uganda along with the European Union.\nA second proposal, sponsored by Japan, calls for an international agreement \u201cto address marine plastic pollution covering the whole life cycle and promoting resource efficiency and circular economy,\u201d including reuse.\nThe key difference is that Japan\u2019s approach concentrates on marine plastic pollution, while the Peru-Rwanda proposal covers plastic pollution in all environments.\nBoth proposals envision establishment of a negotiating committee to complete the new plastic treaty by 2024.\nIf such a plastics treaty is endorsed by the U.N. Environment Assembly, Andersen said it \u201cwould be the most significant global; environmental governance decision since the Paris (Climate) Agreement in 2015.\u201d\nThe environmental group Greenpeace supports the Peru-Rwanda proposal\u2019s full lifecycle approach to addressing plastic pollution.\n\u201cOver 140 countries have declared support for opening negotiations on a global plastic treaty,\u201d said Erastus Ooko, the plastics engagement lead for Greenpeace Africa.\n\u201cHowever, support for negotiations is not enough,\u201d Ooko said. \u201cThese countries should be calling for a legally binding treaty that will match the scale and depth of the plastics crisis.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "How long was Peter Pope? - Saint Peter[5] (died between AD 64 and 68 on the Vatican Hill),[1] also known as Simon Peter, Simeon, Simon (/\u02c8sa\u026am\u0259n/ (audio speaker iconlisten)), Cephas (/\u02c8si\u02d0f\u0259s/),[6] or Peter the Apostle, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, and one of the first leaders of the early Church. Based on contemporary historical data, his papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years;[1] however, the length of his reign was never verified.\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero. He is traditionally counted as the first bishop of Rome\u200d\u2014\u200cor pope\u200d\u2014\u200cand also by Eastern Christian tradition as the first bishop of Antioch. The ancient Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Diocese of Rome,[1] but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to Catholic teaching, Jesus promised Peter a special position in the Church.[7]\n\nIn the New Testament, the name \"Simon Peter\" is found 19 times. He appears repeatedly and prominently in all four gospels as well as the Acts of the Apostles. He is the brother of Saint Andrew, and both were fishermen. The Gospel of Mark in particular was traditionally thought to show the influence of Peter's preaching and eyewitness memories. He is also mentioned, under either the name Peter or Cephas, in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians. The New Testament also includes two general epistles, First Peter and Second Peter, that are traditionally attributed to him, but modern scholarship generally rejects the Petrine authorship of both.[8] However, there is a growing number of scholars that have resuscitated the Petrine authorship of the Petrine epistles.[9]\n\nOutside of the New Testament, several apocryphal books were later attributed to him, in particular the Acts of Peter, Gospel of Peter, Preaching of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, and Judgment of Peter, although scholars believe these works to be pseudoepigrapha.[10][11][12]"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nCarlota Guerrero: the Spanish photographer reframing the female body\nGuerrero has had a meteoric rise since capturing Solange\u2019s album cover in 2016. A new book charts her work to date, exploring her desire to carve out a space of liberation for her female subjects\n\nPhotographer Carlota Guerrero has a vivid memory from her early childhood. In the introduction of her new photobook, she recalls \u201csitting at my desk during school, fantasizing about climbing up on the teacher\u2019s table and taking off my clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers try to stop me, but I flee and run naked like a gazelle, through the corridors, the courtyard of the school and the gymnasium, and through all the public spaces. I feel terribly guilty for having imagined it.\u201d\n\nThis fantasy of escape and liberation remains the central thread of her photography. The self-taught photographer, who is from Barcelona, has been exploring these themes of femininity, body autonomy and exploration for a decade. After being gifted an Olga film camera as a teenager, she started out capturing her friend group\u2019s blissful, naked afternoons by the Mediterranean, and the freedom they felt in each other\u2019s company.\n\nShe credits an LSD trip for furthering this idea of female interconnectedness. \u201cWhen I bring women together in one place and photograph them, I am creating new organisms... as if each woman were an organ or a cell that, by joining the others, makes up a whole being,\u201d she writes.\n\nShe was in her mid-20s when she got her big break. Musician Solange Knowles contacted the then-unknown photographer after seeing her work on Instagram. Guerrero captured the musician in her trademark soft earth tones, hair full of colourful clips to hold the waves of her hair in place, for the cover of her 2016 album Seat at the Table.\n\nIt was a meeting of minds \u2013 Knowles\u2019s wistful, dreamy vision which exposes the awkward hidden details of womanhood dovetailed perfectly with Guerrero\u2019s own offbeat exploration of sensuality and healing. Guerrero would go on to collaborate with Solange on music videos and shoot her next album cover, When I Get Home.\n\nSince her fruitful collaboration with Knowles, Guerrero has become one of the most in-demand photographers working today. She has photographed musicians Arca and Rosalia and the poet Rupi Kaur. She\u2019s worked with fashion royalty, from Helmut Lang to Dior to Philip Lim. During 2019\u2019s Miami Art Basel show, she caused a viral sensation with her performance piece \u201cLove Different\u201d, in partnership with Spanish brand Desigual. The performance ended in a writhing mass of 30 bodies which included Lourdes Leon, Madonna\u2019s daughter.\n\nHer work to date is now collected in Tengo un Dragon Dentro del Corazon: The Photographs of Carlota Guerrero, a new photobook from Prestel, showcasing her distinctive low-contrast tones, seen with a warm and tranquil eye. Guerrero has said in interviews that her aesthetic vision stands in contrast with her own restless, anxious personality. She is also constantly working to see women\u2019s bodies in a different way, from a point of view of joy and camaraderie free from the male gaze.\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, Rupi Kaur recalls a shoot with Guerrero in which she \u201cended up naked in a bed of pink rose petals at her Barcelona studio.\u201d She points out that Guerrero\u2019s fixation on the female body is an attempt to reframe and reclaim them in popular visual culture. It goes beyond representation, even though the women she photographs vary in shape, size and skin tone. Although they tap into a raw sensuality, they are a million miles away from the women offered up for consumption in the pages of magazines Guerrero and her generation grew up seeing.\n\n\u201cCarlota\u2019s work is the antidote to our male-gaze problem,\u201d Kaur writes. \u201cIn an industry dominated by men shooting women\u2019s bodies, Carlota\u2019s vision is refreshing. As a woman, I\u2019m not interested in looking at my body through the eyes of a man anymore. I\u2019ve done that my whole life. I want to see and be shot by a woman whose images are celebrative, not exploitative. Sexy, not voyeuristic. In a world where the feminine is violated, the femininity that Carlota captures is honest and empowering.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Note all locations now in modern day France from the following - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War,[a] often referred to in France as the War of 1870, was a conflict between the Second French Empire (later the Third French Republic) and the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily by France's determination to restore its dominant position in continental Europe, which it had lost following Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in 1866.[10] According to some historians, Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia in order to draw four independent southern German states\u2014Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt\u2014to join the North German Confederation; other historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. None, however, dispute that Bismarck likely recognized the potential for new German alliances, given the situation as a whole.[11]\n\nFrance mobilised its army on 15 July 1870, leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia; France invaded German territory on 2 August. The German coalition mobilised its troops much more effectively than the French and invaded northeastern France on 4 August. German forces were superior in numbers, training, and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology, particularly railways and artillery.\n\nA series of swift Prussian and German victories in eastern France, culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, saw French Emperor Napoleon III captured and the army of the Second Empire decisively defeated; the Government of National Defence declared the Third French Republic in Paris on 4 September and continued the war for another five months. German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France, besieging the capital of Paris for over four months, before it fell on 28 January 1871, effectively ending the war.\n\nIn the waning days of the war, with German victory all but assured, the German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire under the Prussian king Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck; with the notable exception of Austria, the vast majority of Germans were united under a nation-state for the first time in history. Following an armistice with France, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed on 10 May 1871, giving Germany billions of francs in war indemnity, as well as most of Alsace and parts of Lorraine, which became the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsa\u00df-Lothringen).\n\nThe war had a lasting impact on Europe. By hastening the process of German unification, it significantly altered the balance of power on the continent; with the new German nation state supplanting France as the dominant European land power. Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades, developing a reputation for adept and pragmatic diplomacy that raised Germany's global stature and influence. In France, it brought a final end to imperial rule and began the first lasting republican government. Resentment over France's defeat triggered a revolutionary uprising called the Paris Commune, which managed to seize and hold power for two months before its bloody suppression; the event would influence the politics and policies of the Third Republic."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this article for me? I just want to know if I should continue to vape or not \"1: Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it\u2019s still not safe.\nE-cigarettes heat nicotine (extracted from tobacco), flavorings and other chemicals to create an aerosol that you inhale. Regular tobacco cigarettes contain 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic. While we don\u2019t know exactly what chemicals are in e-cigarettes, Blaha says \u201cThere\u2019s almost no doubt that vaping exposes you to fewer toxic chemicals than smoking traditional cigarettes.\u201d\n\nHowever, there has been an outbreak of lung injuries and deaths associated with vaping. In February 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 2,807 cases of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and 68 deaths attributed to that condition.\n\n\u201cThese cases appear to predominantly affect people who modify their vaping devices or use black market modified e-liquids. This is especially true for vaping products containing THC,\u201d explains Blaha.\n\nThe CDC has identified vitamin E acetate as a chemical of concern among people with EVALI. Vitamin E acetate is a thickening agent often used in THC vaping products, and it was found in all lung fluid samples of EVALI patients examined by the CDC.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people:\n\nDo not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products.\nAvoid using informal sources, such as friends, family or online dealers to obtain a vaping device.\nDo not modify or add any substances to a vaping device that are not intended by the manufacturer.\nResearch from The Johns Hopkins University on vape ingredients published in October 2021 reveals thousands of chemical ingredients in vape products, most of which are not yet identified. Among those the team could identify were several potentially harmful substances, including caffeine, three chemicals never previously found in e-cigarettes, a pesticide and two flavorings linked with possible toxic effects and respiratory irritation.\n\n2: Research suggests vaping is bad for your heart and lungs.\nNicotine is the primary agent in regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and it is highly addictive. It causes you to crave a smoke and suffer withdrawal symptoms if you ignore the craving. Nicotine is a toxic substance. It raises your blood pressure and spikes your adrenaline, which increases your heart rate and the likelihood of having a heart attack.\n\nIs vaping bad for you? There are many unknowns about vaping, including what chemicals make up the vapor and how they affect physical health over the long term. \u201cPeople need to understand that e-cigarettes are potentially dangerous to your health,\u201d says Blaha. \u201cEmerging data suggests links to chronic lung disease and asthma, as well as associations between dual use of e-cigarettes and smoking with cardiovascular disease. You\u2019re exposing yourself to all kinds of chemicals that we don\u2019t yet understand and that are probably not safe.\u201d\n\n3: Electronic cigarettes are just as addictive as traditional ones.\nBoth e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes contain nicotine, which research suggests may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine. What\u2019s worse, says Blaha, many e-cigarette users get even more nicotine than they would from a combustible tobacco product: Users can buy extra-strength cartridges, which have a higher concentration of nicotine, or increase the e-cigarette\u2019s voltage to get a greater hit of the substance. 4: Electronic cigarettes aren\u2019t the best smoking cessation tool.\nAlthough they\u2019ve been promoted as an aid to help you quit smoking, e-cigarettes have not received Food and Drug Administration approval as smoking cessation devices. A recent study found that most people who intended to use e-cigarettes to kick the nicotine habit ended up continuing to use traditional and e-cigarettes.\n\nIn light of the EVALI outbreak, the CDC advises people who use e-cigarettes for smoking cessation to weigh the risks and benefits and first consider use of other FDA-approved smoking cessation options.\n\n5: A new generation is getting hooked on nicotine.\nAmong youth, e-cigarettes, especially the disposable kind, are more popular than any traditional tobacco product. According to the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 2 million U.S. middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2021, with more than 8 in 10 of those youth using flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nAccording to Blaha, there are three reasons e-cigarettes may be particularly enticing to young people. First, many teens believe vaping is less harmful than smoking. Second, e-cigarettes have a lower per-use cost than traditional cigarettes. Finally, youths and adults find the lack of smoke appealing. With no smell, e-cigarettes reduce some of the stigma of smoking.\n\n\u201cWhat I find most concerning about the rise of vaping is that people who would\u2019ve never smoked otherwise, especially youth, are taking up the habit,\u201d says Blaha. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you convert from cigarette smoking to vaping. It\u2019s quite another thing to start up nicotine use with vaping. And, getting hooked on nicotine often leads to using traditional tobacco products down the road.\u201d\n\nResearch from the CDC shows that vaping among youth has declined somewhat since 2020. Kids being stuck at home under their parents\u2019 supervision during the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to that trend.\n\nBut, Blaha says, interpreting the data is tricky, since young people change their preferences often, and, when surveyed, may not consider using disposable products such as \u201cpuff bars\u201d as vaping. The same CDC report says disposable e-cigarette use has increased 1,000% among high school students and 400% among middle school students since 2019.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a TLDR version of this article? \"It was only a week ago that the major powers and institutions that hold the Western alliance together were triumphant in their unity over Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine.\nWhat a difference a full-scale invasion has made.\n\nOn Friday morning, Ukraine\u2019s visibly exasperated President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \u201cThis morning, we are defending our country alone,\u201d following Russia\u2019s ground invasion of the capital, Kyiv.\n\nHe said that while Russia was hit with sanctions by the most powerful countries in the world, \u201cthese are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.\u201d According to his tweets, what Zelensky wants is greater military assistance from his allies, including a no-fly zone, and for sanctions to be tightened on Moscow. One of his chief complaints is that Russia was not cut off from SWIFT after the invasion \u2013 a high-security messaging network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nBased on the escalation in fighting, Zelensky can reasonably claim that the unified Western response has not had the immediate effect of deterring Vladimir Putin and his regime from invading Ukraine.\n\nWhich raises the question of why, in light of a full-scale invasion and after months of preparing for war, has the Western response appeared so underwhelming?\n\nAccording to a senior European Union diplomat, member states were ultimately divided when it came to the crunch on how hard to hit Russia \u2013 especially on the matter of SWIFT. \u201cThere is a group of incrementalists who have been arguing that it should happen step-by-step and that we need to keep something in the tank,\u201d the diplomat said. However, they noted that the holdouts happened to have good economic ties to Russia. They particularly criticized member states who wanted to continue exporting luxury goods to Russia. \u201cIt seems to me the incrementalists are looking for ways of not having to swallow the most difficult pill right away.\u201d\nSo, did the EU simply choke at the last minute? It seems a little more complicated than that. Officials from multiple Western governments told CNN that the sanctions were largely in line with what had been expected and in some cases went further than they\u2019d hoped.\n\nA NATO diplomat explained that the sad reality is, the Ukraine crisis could almost have been tailor-made to reveal the limitations of NATO and the EU when the actors involved are not members of either.\n\u201cPeople in NATO are not angry with the EU or other allies. The reality is there is no Article 5 option. Sanctions, no matter how extreme, can only go so far when you are dealing with someone like Putin,\u201d the NATO diplomat said. One EU official agreed, saying that under normal circumstances, a bloc of 27 nations signing off on the hardest sanctions package would be a cause for celebration.\nThe problem is that most sanctions cannot immediately tank an economy in a way that would stop a war in its tracks. And the situation is just different now that Russia has invaded.\n\nThis is the bind Europe finds itself in at the end of a truly dreadful week. It\u2019s easy to say sanctions should be harder or that military options should be on the table, that an imprecise measure of \u201cmore\u201d should be done.\n\nThe West remains utterly united in the belief that this crisis needs to end as soon as possible.\n\nHowever, big institutions are ultimately limited by the will of their members and the desire for conflict from their opponents.\n\nAnd, for now, it feels that this power dynamic is skewed in Russia\u2019s favor.\""}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the Deltacron variant?\n\nIn many countries, as restrictions lift and freedoms are restored, there\u2019s a general feeling that the pandemic is over. There is, however, still the significant concern that a dangerous new variant could emerge.\n\nThis happened when omicron arrived, but we got lucky with that one. Omicron turned out to be more transmissible, but mercifully it hasn\u2019t caused an increase in severe disease in most countries where it is dominant.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t guaranteed. Variants crop up randomly, and new ones have the potential to be more dangerous than previous ones. Another has just arrived, and is currently going by the name deltacron. It is \u2013 as you can probably guess \u2013 a hybrid of delta and omicron, the two variants dominant most recently.\n\nDeltacron\u2019s story begins in mid-February, when scientists at the Institut Pasteur in Paris uploaded a genetic sequence of the coronavirus that looked very different from previous sequences. The virus sample had come from an elderly man in northern France and looked odd. Most of its genetic sequence was the same as delta\u2019s, which was dominant worldwide up until late last year, but the part of the sequence that encodes the virus\u2019s spike protein \u2013 a key part of its external structure, which it uses to get inside cells in the body \u2013 came from omicron.\n\nBy March, three further hybrid genetic sequences had been reported, this time in the US. There are now over 60 logged, across France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the US and the UK.\n\nThere may, however, be different deltacrons. Scientists at the Institut Pasteur have said the deltacron sequences reported in the UK and US have certain differences from those found in other countries. They\u2019ve said that it might be necessary to add a number to these different forms of deltacron, to indicate which is which.\n\nHow these hybrids formed\nIt\u2019s not unusual for viruses to mix and match parts of themselves if two different viruses infect one cell. This is called \u201crecombination\u201d, as one virus combines parts of its genetic sequence with parts from another related virus as it assembles copies of itself. It appears to happen at random during viral replication.\n\nHowever, when there\u2019s a transfer of power from one viral variant to another \u2013 with one variant becoming less common and another more so, meaning both are circulating in the population and there\u2019s a chance for them to simultaneously infect people \u2013 the chance of recombination happening increases. This will have been the situation as omicron emerged to displace delta as the most dominant form worldwide.\n\nRecombination usually creates a new virus that isn\u2019t viable, as the mixing of different genes can interfere with the virus\u2019s ability to make the proteins it needs to survive. But sometimes one does survive, and that appears to be what\u2019s happened with deltacron.\n\nIndeed, as the deltacron hybrids found in the US/UK appear to be different from those found in mainland Europe, it\u2019s possible that this has happened multiple times separately.\n\nA chip off the old block?\nAt the moment it\u2019s hard to say in what ways deltacron will resemble its parents. Delta and omicron are quite different viruses. They differ in how they infect cells and how they evade immunity. We still don\u2019t know enough about deltacron to be able to tell how different it\u2019s going to be to either.\n\nBecause it\u2019s been found in multiple nearby countries, it\u2019s likely that deltacron can spread. However, omicron itself is continuing to spread widely in Europe, so it\u2019s still the variant we need to be watching carefully right now."}

The Americans witness the Norwegian passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot shoots at the dog and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burned remains of a malformed humanoid which they recover to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, performs autopsies on the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.\n\nClark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the new creature and learns that it can perfectly imitate other organisms. Recovered Norwegian data leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Norris estimates that the alien ship has been buried for at least 100,000 years. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates that the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The station implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.\n\nThe malformed humanoid creature assimilates an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. Blair sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. The team imprisons him in a tool shed. Copper suggests a test to compare each member's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning that the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry, and MacReady takes command.\n\nMacReady, Windows and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. On their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack.\n\nAs Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady is forced to kill Clark in self-defense when the latter lunges at him from behind with a knife. He hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing's head demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life form with its own survival instinct. He has everyone tied up and sequentially tests blood samples with a heated piece of wire. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood jumps from the heat. Exposed, Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.\n\nChilds is left on guard while the others go to test Blair. They find that Blair has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer. On their return, Childs is missing and the power generator is destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to detonate the entire station to destroy the Thing. As they set explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Transforming into an enormous creature, Blair-Thing destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the explosives using a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.\n\nMacReady sits nearby as the station burns. Childs returns, saying he became lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch."}

More than 350 miles (560 km) of unpaved and four-wheel-drive roads provide access to wilderness hiking, camping, and historical sites.[55] All vehicles must be licensed and street legal. Unlike many other national parks in the U.S. there are no formal entrance stations, and instead entry fees can be paid at the visitor centers, ranger stations, or various fee machines around the park.[56] There are hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulties, but most backcountry areas are accessible only by cross-country hiking. There are thousands of hiking possibilities. The normal season for visiting the park is from October 15 to May 15, avoiding summer extremes in temperature. Costumed living history tours of the historic Death Valley Scotty's Castle were conducted for a fee, but were suspended in October 2015 due to flood damage to the buildings and grounds. It is not expected to re-open until 2020.[57][needs update]\n\n\nA tourist sliding down Star Dune in the Mesquite Flat dune field\nThere are nine designated campgrounds within the park, and overnight backcountry camping permits are available at the Visitor Center.[58] Xanterra Parks & Resorts owns and operates a private resort, the Oasis at Death Valley,[45] which comprises two separate and distinct hotels: the Inn at Death Valley is a four-star historic hotel, and the Ranch at Death Valley is a three-star ranch-style property reminiscent of the mining and prospecting days. Panamint Springs Resort is in the western part of the park. Death Valley Lodging Company operates the Stovepipe Wells Resort under a concession permit. There are a few motels near entrances to the park, in Shoshone, Death Valley Junction, Beatty, and Pahrump.\n\nFurnace Creek Visitor Center is located on CA-190. A 22-minute introductory slide program is shown every 30 minutes.[59] During the winter season\u2014November through April\u2014rangers offer interpretive tours and a wide variety of walks, talks, and slide presentations about Death Valley cultural and natural history. The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The Death Valley Natural History Association maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park.\n\nThe northeast corner of Saline Valley has several developed hot spring pools. The pools can be accessed by driving on the unpaved Saline Valley Road for several hours, or by flying a personal aircraft to the Chicken Strip\u2014an uncharted airstrip a short walk from the springs.[60]\n\nDeath Valley National Park is a popular location for stargazing as it has one of the darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its remote location, air quality and night visibility are threatened by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas.[61] The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.[62] The northwestern area of the park, including sites such as Ubehebe Crater, is a Bortle class 1 or \"excellent dark sky\" site.[63] The Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy are visible to the unaided eye under these conditions, and the Milky Way casts shadows; optical phenomena such as zodiacal light or \"false dawn\" and gegenschein are also visible to the unaided eye under these conditions.[64][65] Most southern regions of the park are Bortle class 2 or \"average dark sky\" sites.[66]"}

{"prompt": "The U.S. is seriously considering making daylight saving time permanent, a move that would likely be popular. But history suggests that opinion might not last.\n\nAbout three-quarters of Americans recently said they would prefer not switching back and forth between between standard and daylight saving time, a poll conducted in October 2021 from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found. Experts have lamented that changing the clocks has wide-ranging negative consequences, from sleep disruptions to a temporary uptick in traffic accidents.\n\nEighteen states have already moved to adopt DST year-round but cannot do so without congressional approval, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida said Tuesday.\n\nAnd now the U.S. Senate has moved to do away with the bi-annual clock change.\n\nBut 48 years ago, the U.S. tried the same thing \u2013 and public opinion of the change quickly deteriorated,\nleading lawmakers to rapidly reverse course. The U.S. is set up for a similar rude awakening if it makes daylight saving time permanent, according to David Prerau, an expert and author on DST.\n\nThe public liked the idea of avoiding the confusion and frustration of changing the clocks by an hour twice a year. But soon Americans realized what permanent daylight saving time meant: Sunrises at 8 a.m. or later in the middle of winter. In some areas, sunrises could be as late as 9:30 a.m., said Prerau.\nCan you summarize this into 2 concise bullet points please?"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nWho Is Julia Kristeva?\n\nJulia Kristeva is a name that often gets bounced around in conversations about contemporary theory and philosophy. But who, exactly, is Kristeva, and why is she so important? Born in Bulgaria in 1941, she moved to France at the age of 23, and here she became a leader in philosophy, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Her writing has encompassed various subjects including sociology, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and art history. She has also published more than 30 books and leading scholarly essays, and been awarded a series of prestigious prizes including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize. Let\u2019s take a look at her life and work in more detail.\n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leader In Semiotics\n\nThroughout her career, Kristeva has pursued the subject of semiotics, or the study of signs, symbols and language. She trained in linguistics at the University of Sofia, before moving to France in the 1960s. In France, Kristeva became a member of the Tel Quel group, a band of French academics who published the literary journal Tel Quel. The journal gave Kristeva a platform to explore ideas around the politics of language. \n\nTwo of Her Most Important Early Publications Explored Semiotics\n\nKristeva\u2019s early work with Tel Quel became the foundation for her first two publications, Semeiotik\u00e8 (1969) and La R\u00e9volution du langage po\u00e9tique (The Revolution of Poetic Language) (1974). These texts drew on Freudian, Lacanian, and Kleinian psychoanalysis, examining how language, culture and ideologies are built out of unconscious body and gender-based dimensions. Further training in psychoanalysis in the 1970s deepened Kristeva\u2019s belief that unconscious emotions and feelings are intertwined with the meaning invested into our forms of communication.\n\n \n\nAfter the Birth of Her Son, Julia Kristeva Became Increasingly Interested In Child Psychology\n\nFollowing the birth of her son in the 1970s, Kristeva began exploring the semiotic link between mother and child. Her iconic text of this period was Pouvoirs de l\u2019horreur (Powers of Horror) (1980/1982), which explored the power struggle between mother and child as the child eventually rejects their mother in order to find themselves. She calls this rejection of the mother \u201cabjection\u201d, and she believed her notion of the abject would come to replay throughout the human\u2019s adult life in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nKristeva Wrote About the Role of Abjection In Adulthood\n\nSome of Kristeva\u2019s most graphic and disturbing writing explains how we experience the \u201cabject\u201d as adults. She outlines the kinds of horrible, unappealing objects, smells or experiences we naturally reject, such as milk-skin, fingernail clippings, dead bodies, human waste and so on... Not the most enjoyable read. But it does give us a fascinating insight into the workings of the human mind, and the way we respond to external stimuli outside our own body. \n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leading Feminist\n\nAmong her many achievements, Kristeva has been recognized as a leader in feminist theory. She has written extensively about women\u2019s bodies, particularly in relation to motherhood, and the role they play as a primal source of rhythm, tone and movement for every human being before it comes into the real world. One of her most important feminist essays is Women\u2019s Time (1979). In this work she argues there are three types of feminism. The first, which seeks universal equality, overlooking any sexual differences. The second phase emphasizes a uniquely feminine language, which she ultimately disregards as impossible, because she believes gender is too diverse to easily categorize. The third phase of Kristeva\u2019s feminism explores multiple identities, suggesting there are as many different kinds of sexualities are there are people. It\u2019s a fascinating theory that is particularly relevant for today\u2019s culture, which has opened up many debates about the complexities of gender, sexuality and identity."}

{"prompt": "Can you use this text to tell me 3 facts about foxes?\n\nFoxes are omnivorous mammals that are light on their feet. They are often mistaken for other members of the Canidae family, which include jackals, wolves and dogs. They stand out from their relatives because of their long, thin legs, lithe frame, pointed nose and bushy tail.\n\nThese animals are very social and live flexible lives. They are found all over the world \u2014 in North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa \u2014 and call a wide range of terrains their home. They also eat a greatly varied diet.\n\nSize\nMost foxes are around the same size as medium-sized dogs. Since foxes are smaller mammals, they are also quite light. They can weigh as little as 1.5 lbs. (680 grams) and as much as 24 lbs. (11 kg). The fennec fox is the smallest living fox and doesn't get any bigger than a cat \u2014 about 9 inches (23 centimeters) and weighing 2.2 to 3.3 lbs. (1 to 1.5 kilograms), according to National Geographic. Other species can grow to 34 inches (86 cm) from their head to their flanks. Their tails can add an additional 12 to 22 inches (30 to 56 cm) to their length. \n\nHabitat\nFoxes usually live in forested areas, though they are also found in mountains, grasslands and deserts. They make their homes by digging burrows in the ground. These burrows, also called dens, provide a cool area to sleep, a good location to store food and a safe place to have their pups. Burrows are dug-out tunnels that have rooms for the fox and its family to live in. The burrows also have several exits so that they can flee if a predator enters the burrow.\n\nHabits\nFoxes are very social creatures that live in packs. A group of foxes are called a leash, skulk or earth, according to the U.S. Department of Interior. They are also called packs. No matter what you call them, foxes like to stick near family members. A pack may include older siblings, foxes of breeding age, mates and mothers. Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, and females are called vixens.\n\nThese mammals like to hunt at night and are nocturnal. This means that they sleep during the day. This can change, though, depending on where the fox pack lives. If they live in a place where they feel safe, a fox pack may hunt during the daytime, according to National Parks and Wildlife Service of Ireland.\n\nFoxes have great eyesight. They can see just as well as a cat, in fact. Their eyes are much like a cat's thanks to their vertically slit pupils.\n\nFoxes are also very fast. They can run up to 45 mph (72 km/h). That is almost as fast as the blackbuck antelope, one of the world's fastest animals.\n\nDiet\nFoxes are omnivores. This means that they eat meat and vegetation. A fox's diet can consist of small animals, such as lizards, voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. They round out their diet with birds, fruits and bugs, according to the Smithsonian. Foxes that live near the ocean eat fish and crabs, as well. If they have trouble finding food, a fox will have no problem raiding trash cans to find scraps.\n\nFoxes can eat up to several pounds of food a day. What they don't eat, they often bury under leaves or snow for later.\n\nOffspring\nFox babies are called pups. During mating season, the female will cry out to let males know that she is ready. After mating, females will make a nest of leaves inside her burrow on which to have her pups. This special room in the burrow is called a nesting chamber.\n\nThe pregnant female only carries her pups for a gestation period of 53 days. There are usually two to seven pups in a litter. Pup care is a family affair. Both the mother and father share the care of pups. Even older siblings will help take care of their younger brother and sisters by bringing them food.\n\nFoxes live very short lives in the wild. They often live only around three years, according to the Animal Diversity Web. In captivity, they can live much longer. Foxes in zoos, for example, can live 10 to 12 years."}

Place a glass or metal bowl on top of the pot, making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water.\nAdd 1/2 cup of sugar, flour, and salt to the bowl.\nBeat in the egg yolks and milk, and stir until the mixture is well-combined.\nCook the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the milk from burning.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and mix in the vanilla.\nSpread a small amount of the custard at the bottom of a 1 1/2-quart casserole.\nLayer Nilla Wafers on top of the custard. Top with a layer of sliced bananas.\nPour a third of the custard over the bananas. Continue layering until you get three layers of each component, ending with the custard. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo make the meringue topping, beat the egg whites with a mixer until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. You\u2019ll know the egg whites are done when they\u2019re glossy and they form a firm peak that holds its shape when you lift the beater.\nSpoon over the meringue over the pudding, making sure the entire surface is covered well.\nBake the pudding for 5 minutes or until the meringue has turned light golden brown.\nLet the pudding cool to room temperature. Chill in the fridge before serving.\nGarnish with banana slices and place Nilla Wafers around the edge of the dish."}

I\u2019d embrace the \u201cinsult,\u201d but at 15 \u2013 when you don\u2019t want to stand out from your peers in any way \u2013 being outed for wearing cheap clothes made you an object of ridicule.\n\nI\u2019m just glad that there was no social media in those days, because instead of saying it to me, that friend would have posted it on Twitter or Facebook and I\u2019d have had to leave school for the day or forever.\n\nThat had already happened once before, after the Natural Four performed on Soul Train one Saturday and I, smitten by their funky hairstyle, showed up at Richmond Senior High School on Monday with my hair permed, too.\n\nIt was in the bathroom before first period when my pal Raymond gawked at my new \u2019do and inquired \u201cWhat the hell\u2019d you do to yer hair?\u201d\n\nI left school immediately, went home and spent the next several hours washing Murray\u2019s hair pomade out of it.\n\nWhat\u2019s that got to do with my Family Dollar Stores shirt?\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson recently blamed such \u201cdollar stores\u201d for messing up the environment.\n\n\u201cAmerica is getting much dirtier and there are like Dollar Stores everywhere and people litter... Maybe it\u2019s an intentional effort to weaken the country, maybe they just don\u2019t like America...\u201d\n\nDollar stores are, he said \u201ca blot on God\u2019s creation.\u201d\n\nSorry, old bean, but we can\u2019t all be related to heiresses of the Swanson frozen food fortune.\n\nThe poor in America have always been demonized, but don\u2019t they, too, deserve to be able to shop in a nice store, to clothe and feed their families?\n\nCharlotte can lay claim to the first Family Dollar Store, which would be followed by more than 8,200 others, but the family that started it got its business start in Rockingham.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why I was insulted when Carlson blamed them for messing up the environment.\n\nJ. Neal Cadieu, publisher of the Richmond County Daily Journal when I worked there in the 1980s, was an adolescent paperboy there in the 1940s when his father was publisher.\n\n\u201cI remember Minnie and Harry,\u201d he said, speaking of the parents of Leon Levine, Family Dollar\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cAt the time, they owned the Hub\u201d clothing store downtown, he said, and Harry Levine and he had a little business tete-a\u2019-tete they\u2019d perform when he went in to collect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d walk in and Harry \u2013 of course, I called him Mr. Levine - would say \u2018I\u2019ve already paid you, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 I would pull out my book and look and say \u2018No, you didn\u2019t,\u2019 and he\u2019d laugh, say \u2018I was just kidding,\u2019 pull out the dime and hand it to me...\n\nDespite my denial of my shirt\u2019s provenance, Family Dollar Stores in the 1960s and 1970s helped a whole lot of working class people stay clothed.\n\nBack before the chain seemingly switched its emphasis to household goods and cleaning supplies and Funyons, you could get an entire outfit for $6. I know that because, when the store opened in Rockingham, it boasted \u201cnothing over $3.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think that a $3 shirt and pair of britches wouldn\u2019t last very long, but they did. The clothes were inexpensive, not cheap.\n\nSure, once when I put on a brand new pair of corduroy pants from there, the button popped off with such velocity that people over in Hamlet were ducking, but that often happened regardless of where I bought my pants.\n\nI, for one, still appreciate dollar stores, and consider neither them or the people who shop there \u201ca blot on God\u2019s creation.\u201d\n\nFor many, they are a blessing.\nCan you please write a more concise and professional summary?"}

{"prompt": "Referring the article below, could you summarize it into two sentences?\n\nThe Dreamachine (a contraction of Dream Machine) is a stroboscopic flicker device that produces visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7]"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain to me how jail works in Monopoly?\n\nThe rules of Monopoly are not difficult, but they are specific. Monopoly can be played by 2+ players, depending on the number of player tokens available.\n\n\nMonopoly requires a special board, 32 houses, 12 hotels, Chance and Community Chest cards, Title Deed cards for each property, play money, player tokens, and two six-sided dice.\n\nEach player chooses a token and places it on \u2018Go\u2019, and is provided with $1500 as follows: 2 of each $500\u2019s, $100\u2019s, and $50\u2019s; 6 $20\u2019s; and 5 of each $10\u2019s, $5\u2019s, and $1\u2019s. One player is the Banker. All assets of the Bank should be separate from the Banker\u2019s own assets. The Bank controls all remaining money and all properties and buildings until they are purchased. The Bank can never \u2018go broke\u2019 \u2013 more money should be made if needed.\nGame Play\nAccording to the rules of Monopoly, the player that roles the highest total on both dice goes first. Game play proceeds clockwise from that player.\n\nThere are 4 main parts to a turn.\n1) Roll the dice. Move the number of squares indicated. If you throw doubles, you take another turn after your turn is completed. Each time you pass \u2018Go\u2019, collect $200 from the Bank.\n\n2) Buy properties. You may buy any property from the Bank that you land on if it is not already owned. If you do not purchase the property, the Banker auctions the property to the highest bidder.\n\nSome people chose not to use auctions, only allowing properties to be purchased as they are landed on.\n\n3) Building. You may only build when you own all properties in a color group. Building must be equal on all properties in a group. You may place a single building on a single property, but you may not place two buildings on one property unless all other properties in the group have one building present (even build rule). Any property can have a total of 4 houses, except Utilities and Railroads, which cannot be devloped. To place a hotel on a property, 4 houses must be present on all properties in the group. Houses are removed from the property when a hotel is placed. All buildings are purchased from the Bank.\n\n4) Complete necessary actions. Pay rent as determined by the Title Deed for the property you are on. Pay Income Tax to the Bank ($200 or 10% of your total assets). Draw a Community Chest or Chance card and follow the instructions. These cards are returned to the bottom of the pile when the action is completed.\n\nGoing to Jail\n\nIn the rules of Monopoly, there are 3 ways to be sent to \u2018Jail\u2019:\n\n1) Land on a space marked \u2018Go to Jail\u2019\n2) Draw a card marked \u2018Go to Jail\u2019\n3) Roll doubles three times in a row\n\nThere are 4 ways to get out of \u2018Jail\u2019\n\n1) Pay the $50 fine before rolling the dice\n2) Use a \u2018Get Out Of Jail Free Card\u2019 before rolling the dice\n3) Roll doubles\n4) After the 3rd failed attempt to roll doubles, you must pay the $50 fine and leave jail\n\nWhen you get out of \u2018Jail\u2019, move the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Even while in \u2018Jail\u2019, you may buy and sell property and collect any rent owed to you. You are not sent to \u2018Jail\u2019 if you land on the \u2018Jail\u2019 square during normal game play, and you do not incur a fine.\n\nMoney to Pay Rent, etc\n\nThe rules of Monopoly state, if you do not have enough money to pay Rent or other obligations during your turn, you may chose to sell houses, hotels, or property. Buildings may be sold to the Bank for one-half of the purchase price. Buildings may not be sold to other players. Unimproved properties (including railroad and utilities) can be sold to any player for any amount.\n\nUnimproved properties can also be mortgaged to the Bank for the value mortgage value printed on the Title Deed. No rent is collected on mortgaged properties. To lift a mortgage, the player must pay the Bank the mortgage amount plus 10% interest. Players retain possession of mortgaged properties. If that player chooses, he or she may sell the mortgaged property to another player for any price. The property would remain mortgaged, and the new owner would have to pay the Bank the same mortgage + 10% to lift the mortgage.\n\nWinning the Game\n\nYou may chose to end the game at any time and tally the total worth of each player (including buildings and all property worth). You may also chose to play until all but one player has been declared Bankrupt. Bankruptcy occurs when a player owes more than he or she can pay. You must turn over all that you have including money and Title Deeds to the Bank or another player, depending on who the current debt is owed to. Any player who has declared Bankruptcy is no longer part of the game. According to the rules of Monopoly, the last player in the game, or the player with the most money, wins."}

{"prompt": "Can you rewrite the following story to make it sound better for narration. I plan to animate the story and do a voice over for the animation. Here is the original version of the story.\n\nWhen I was 18, my boyfriend Jake (21) and I spontaneously decided to go to Canada to go bar hopping. It was a few hours away from our home, so we made the trip. After getting settled in the hotel, we went to the first bar. We had a drink, then went in search of a new bar. Jake and I were chatting and walking when a man in a big puffy coat stopped and introduced himself as Ian. He noticed we were speaking English and invited us to go bar hopping with him. Turned out he lived just a few hours from where we lived.\n\nAfter a few bars we met up with 2 of his friends and went in the strip club. Ian paid our cover charge and drinks with a HUGE wad of cash. I had never seen that much before. We started talking about weed, and Ian invited us to his hotel room to smoke. I had had way too much to drink at that point, off being sick in the bathroom after one puff. Thankfully Jake wasn't that drunk and we both eventually made our way back to the hotel. What a crazy night.\n\nThe next morning after a hangover breakfast we were walking to our car to leave when all of a sudden, Ian and his friends start calling our names. We all remarked how strange it was to run into each other again. Ian invited us all for a smoke at his friend's house.\n\nIt was a shady looking, rundown apartment. We smoke and somehow the topic turned to how Ian makes so much money. Without directly saying it, I could tell he was into drug smuggling, possibly over the border. Ian suggested that I could make some good money doing the same.. my heart dropped and I immediately felt uncomfortable. Unsafe. I needed to get out of that apartment, that city, that country. Jake looked over and saw how freaked out I was.\n\nWe casually played it off, 'Yeah okay' like he was joking, but Ian's friends started nodding their heads, suggesting where I can hide it. Jake gave Ian his real phone number (why, idk) and we said our goodbyes as we had a long drive home.\n\nJake is driving, and shortly after we take off we see Ian's car behind us. Very weird. We make a few turns, got a little lost, and he was still there. Jake made a few more erratic turns just to lose him. We both did NOT have a good feeling about Ian anymore. Finally, we made it across the border, no Ian in sight. It was a weird drive home.\n\nA week or two later, Ian called up Jake on the phone. I have no clue what was said, but I know we never picked up a call from him again.\n\nMaybe it was a close call, maybe not. But I got that deep gut-sinking feeling that something bad was going to happen if we were in Ian's presence any longer. Listen to your gut feelings."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary of this text?\n\nAfter nearly a year of operations, NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars helicopter is still \u201cas good as new\u201d as it serves as a scout for the Perseverance rover.\n\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced March 11 that Ingenuity completed its 21st flight on the planet, traveling 370 meters during the 129-second flight. The helicopter has now traveled more than 4.6 kilometers since its first flight in April 2021.\n\nIngenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, with an original plan of no more than five flights over a month. The excellent performance of the 1.8-kilogram helicopter, though, led NASA to extend its mission, using it as a scout to examine terrain ahead of the Perseverance rover that carried Ingenuity to Mars.\n\nThe information Ingenuity has provided has created some modest time savings for Perseverance. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly shaved several sols, maybe a week, off of the time frame of the rover by having this advanced information,\u201d said Matt Golombek, a senior research scientist at JPL who has been involved with Mars landers dating back to Mars Pathfinder, during a March 8 media briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference. A sol is a Martian day, about 40 minutes longer than a terrestrial day.\n\nOther scientists involved with Perseverance agreed that Ingenuity has been useful. \u201cI was really impressed with how well it worked and how useful it\u2019s been,\u201d said Justin Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center who works on the Perseverance mission, during a conference session March 7. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was fully anticipated, at least by myself.\u201d\n\nKeyron Hickman-Lewis of the U.K.\u2019s Natural History Museum, another Perseverance scientist, said at that conference session that Ingenuity has been particularly helpful as Perseverance negotiated a region called S\u00e9\u00edtah. \u201cThe terrain is not optimal for a rover,\u201d he said of the region. \u201cThese insights have been invaluable.\u201d\n\nThat work will continue as Perseverance heads in the coming weeks to the remnants of a river delta. \u201cThe intent is to keep the helicopter out in front of the rover to provide advance information that would help in its exploration,\u201d Golombek said. That includes scouting paths the rover could take into the delta and identifying rocks for the rover to study with its instrument suite.\n\nIngenuity itself has shown no signs of wear and tear after nearly a year of flying on Mars. \u201cSo far, we have found no degradation or loss of anything on the helicopter. It is as good as new,\u201d he said.\n\nThe helicopter, which uses solar power, also has no consumables to limit its life. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing consumable and nothing to stop us from continuing to operate as long as the helicopter remains healthy,\u201d he said, with the expectation Ingenuity will continue operations until something finally breaks.\n\nThat performance is all the more noteworthy, he added, because of the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts that had been previously qualified for space on Ingenuity, rather than customized components. \u201cIt is rather remarkable that we\u2019ve had no degradation or loss of any aspect of the helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\nGolombek said the performance of Ingenuity demonstrates how useful such helicopters could be in future exploration, although NASA has no firm plans currently for additional helicopter missions. \u201cThe idea of a technology demo is to demonstrate that here is a new way to explore Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cIngenuity has shown the promise of this sort of way to continue our exploration of the red planet.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "What are the most important facts in this article? \"Napoleon Dynamite (Heder) is a socially awkward 16-year-old from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his grandmother, Carlinda Dynamite, and his older brother, Kipland Ronald \"Kip\" Dynamite. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, reluctantly dealing with various bullies who torment him.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother is injured in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme to sell items door-to-door. Kip wants money to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to travel from Detroit to see him while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon.\n\nPedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The factions of the two candidates put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a Future Farmers of America competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a thrift store and buys an instructional dance VHS called D-Qwon's Dance Grooves, becoming a skillful dancer.\n\nKip's girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives from Detroit and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"Larger than Life\" by the Backstreet Boys with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai. Napoleon's routine receives a standing ovation from students, stunning Summer, and her boyfriend, Don.\n\nPedro becomes the class president, Kip, and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, Rico reunites with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returns from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play tetherball.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 facts about avalanches based on the text below?\n\nAvalanches are most common during the winter, December to April in the Northern Hemisphere, but they do occur year-round.\n\nTo get an avalanche, you need a surface bed of snow, a weaker layer that can collapse, and an overlaying snow slab. The highest risk period is during and immediately after a snow storm. Underlying snowpack, overloaded by a quick deluge of snow, can cause a weak layer beneath the slab to fracture naturally.\n\nHuman-triggered avalanches start when somebody walks or rides over a slab with an underlying weak layer. The weak layer collapses, causing the overlaying mass of snow to fracture and start to slide. Earthquakes can also trigger strong avalanches.\n\nBy digging a snow pit or profile, scientists can look at the composition of different snow layers that formed during a season, sort of like looking at the layers of a cake. The size and shape of the snowflakes in each layer provide clues about the weather events that occurred: big dumps of snow, drought, rain, a hard freeze, or loose, powdery snow. Larger, looser snow crystals are weaker, because there are fewer points they can touch to interact with the other snow layers. The interaction of the snow layers can help predict the chances of an avalanche.\n\n\u201cSnow is an incredibly dynamic and complicated medium, which means avalanches are the same,\u201d says Trautman. He emphasizes that conditions can change rapidly with the weather, and this can be deadly.\n\nSlopes shaded from direct sun stay cooler, preventing bonding between snow layers and leading to more avalanches in cold conditions. Conversely, during the spring, sunny mountainsides have a higher risk for avalanches because of rapid warming and melting. The number of \u201cwet snow\u201d slides could increase in the future with climate change, experts warn.\n\nPrecipitation type and intensity, temperature, wind, slope steepness and orientation (the direction it faces), terrain, vegetation, and general snowpack conditions can influence whether and how snow moves down a slope. Moving across the terrain, slight changes in slope or how the mountainside is oriented towards the sun can create drastically different conditions."}

The Vanced owners say they\u2019ve had to discontinue the project \u201cdue to legal reasons.\u201d\n\nGoogle sent the Vanced owners a cease and desist letter recently, which has forced the developers to stop distributing and developing the app. \u201cWe were asked to remove all references to \u2018YouTube\u2019, change the logo, and remove all links related to YouTube products,\u201d says an admin from the Vanced team in a Discord message to The Verge.\n\nVanced is a popular third-party YouTube app for Android, particularly because it allows YouTube users to block all video ads on YouTube without a Premium subscription.

{"prompt": "What does this text say that hyenas eat?\n\nThese interesting carnivores live in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. They are able to survive in savannas and swamps, as well as semi-arid regions, and even mountainous forest areas. Rather than resting in dens, adult spotted hyenas sleep in holes or shallow pools or under bushes or scrubs\u2014anywhere they can find shade during the heat of the day. Hyenas use watering holes as places to cool off or to hide extra food. Spotted hyenas can be active both day and night, depending on their needs and whether there are humans around, but they are generally nocturnal.\n\nLions and hyenas compete over the same food in overlapping territories. Sometimes the hyenas do the work of organizing, chasing down, and killing prey only to have lions steal it. Lions often injure or kill hyenas as they fight over a carcass. Both hyenas and lions mark and establish territories, and both species are always on guard. When confronted by a lion, the spotted hyena calls for help from other hyenas.\n\nIn a large group, spotted hyenas are able to chase lions away from a kill. But during a hunt, the hyena's impressive hunting skills come into play. They are able to chase down prey over long distances while running at up to 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour). \n\nSpotted hyenas often pick out the young or weak from the herd, but they can kill even healthy adult ungulates. What they hunt depends on numbers. The bigger the hyena clan, the larger its prey. This can include young rhinos, adult wildebeest, zebras, and Cape buffalo. The hyenas work in a group when hunting such large prey, and young hyenas take years to become successful. Smaller packs chase down gazelles, impalas, warthogs, and waterbucks.\n\nWhen hunting alone, a spotted hyena may go after smaller prey. Ground birds, rabbits, springhare, bat-eared foxes, porcupines, jackals, and fish can be on the menu. Even ostrich eggs are fair game! Spotted hyenas also scavenge, but they have to compete with jackals and vultures for these leftovers.\n\nA hyena can eat quite a bit at one time. Sometimes, leftovers are buried in a mud hole for a later meal. Spotted hyenas give new meaning to the phrase \"lick the platter clean.\" They eat practically every part of their prey, including skin, hooves, bone, and teeth. Powerful jaws are able to crush bones with ease. Most other predators couldn\u2019t eat those things, even if they tried. There are some items that hyenas can\u2019t digest, such as hair and horns, although they still eat them."}

In the days of the internet, it seems like it\u2019s gotten much harder to tell.\n\nSocial media and the instant expert\n\nSocial media makes it possible for anyone to have a platform, giving rise to the phenomenon known as the instant expert. These self-appointed authorities on everything from federal policy to last night\u2019s episode of This Is Us can hop on Twitter and share their hot takes in a multi-Tweet thread in the time it takes most people to make a sandwich.\n\nIf it\u2019s a title almost anyone can claim, has the meaning of the word changed?\n\nWhat did expert use to mean?\n\nThe word expert has been in use since the 1300s ... long before social media was a thing.\n\nIt comes from the Latin expertus, meaning \u201cto try\u201d or \u201cexperience.\u201d But in modern times, expert applies specifically to \u201ca person who has special skills or knowledge in a particular field.\u201d An expert is typically someone who specializes in a subject to the extent that they are considered an authority. They\u2019re someone who can engage with a subject from multiple angles and who has developed their knowledge over time through a combination of research and experience. That cultivation takes time, lots of time, to develop.\n\nBut when the internet came along, it changed how we think about expertise. Now, anyone can give their opinion on an issue (and go viral for it); anyone can start a website or post a review of a movie, restaurant, or product. That transparency has been a good thing in the sense that it\u2019s given more people a voice, even some legitimate experts who were being crowded out of the arena. But it also poses the risk that the voices of actual, legitimate experts sometimes get crowded out instead.\n\nWhy does everyone think they\u2019re an expert now?\n\nAn article on Glassdoor.com promises to teach anyone how to become an expert in digital media. \n\nStep one? \u201cFind something you\u2019re passionate about, and start blogging about it.\u201d \n\nSupposing someone follows the steps laid out in that piece, does additional reading, or maybe even takes an online course in SEO, are they then qualified to, say, weigh in on the recent layoffs of more than 1,000 journalists by HuffPost, Buzzfeed, Gannett, and Verizon media?\n\nIt\u2019d be elitist to say that all experts must have formal education and decades of experience. Not everyone has the privilege of being able to afford a university education, has special training, or has even been alive long enough to have had a decades-long career, and that doesn\u2019t make their experience or knowledge less valid. There are real self-made experts who revolutionize their fields. It\u2019s just that the internet and its armchair experts don\u2019t always make it easy for people to know which voices can and should be trusted.\n\nAre armchair experts a bad thing, though?\n\nThe internet has created a platform for the so-called armchair expert. This phrase describes \u201csomeone who asserts their knowledge of a subject without having a real understanding of it.\u201d \n\nNeed an example? When the trailer dropped for the Ted Bundy movie, Extremely Wicked, Shocking, Evil and Vile, it launched a huge debate on social media about how the director chose to portray Bundy.\n\nMajor news sources quickly picked up the story that the biopic had been accused of glamorizing a serial killer, which caught the attention of even more people. Now, a quick search of \u201cTed Bundy trailer\u201d on Twitter yields a complex conversation about character development, film making, the portrayal of criminals by the media, and how to cut a movie trailer properly. And it\u2019s average people, not experts, who do most of the talking.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, though. In fact, the actor Dax Shepard has actually found a unique way to capitalize on conversations between non-expert individuals that can often yield truly complex and meaningful results. He hosts a hit podcast called Armchair Expert, where he interviews celebrity guests about their own careers, personal struggles, and unique life experiences. \u201cI will attempt to discover human \u2018truths\u2019 without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection,\u201d he says of the podcast\u2019s premise. \u201cI will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.\u201d\n\nAnd, armchair experts are just that: Experts who dole out the sort of information one can develop sitting in their own armchairs.\n\nThe underlying problem is misinformation\n\nThe problem comes when the exchange of ideas spreads misinformation that is not challenged because \u201canyone can be an expert.\u201d As Washington state battled a huge measles outbreak at the end of January 2019, the anti-vaccination experts are out in force, including Larry Cook, a California naturopath who used the outbreak as an opportunity to fundraise to spread his anti-vaccine message to more parents.\n\nThe doctors and health officials promoting vaccination have extensive knowledge and experience in the medical field. Many of the people who are speaking out against vaccines do not. And yet, someone like Cook has over 21,000 followers on Facebook, many of whom are spreading his beliefs as fact.\n\nIn many ways, our expanding ideas about expertise have led to meaningful thought and discussion on a previously unimagined scale before the internet or social media. \n\nBut with large platforms comes great responsibility. And the knowledge that almost anyone can claim authority on a given subject should encourage us to think critically and often about what it really means to be an expert. \n\nMaybe we all have to step up to become experts in weeding through the infinite information now at our fingertips."}

{"prompt": "Could you extract the poem for the following story? Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.[192] The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical\u2014written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.[193][194]\n\n\nPity by William Blake, 1795, Tate Britain, is an illustration of two similes in Macbeth:\n\"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air.\"[195]\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.[196][197] No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.[198] By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\n\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.[199] Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:[200]\n\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly\u2014\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it\u2014let us know\nOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...\n\n\u2014 Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, 4\u20138[200]\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\".[201] In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.[202] In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35\u201338); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21\u201325). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.[202] The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.[203]\n\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.[204] Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed.[205] He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.[206] As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a few important details from this article?\n\nThe count of confirmed exoplanets just ticked past the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA space telescopes.\n\nNot so long ago, we lived in a universe with only a small number of known planets, all of them orbiting our Sun. But a new raft of discoveries marks a scientific high point: More than 5,000 planets are now confirmed to exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe planetary odometer turned on March 21, with the latest batch of 65 exoplanets \u2013 planets outside our immediate solar family \u2013 added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The archive records exoplanet discoveries that appear in peer-reviewed, scientific papers, and that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods or by analytical techniques.\n\nThe 5,000-plus planets found so far include small, rocky worlds like Earth, gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, and \u201chot Jupiters\u201d in scorchingly close orbits around their stars. There are \u201csuper-Earths,\u201d which are possible rocky worlds bigger than our own, and \u201cmini-Neptunes,\u201d smaller versions of our system\u2019s Neptune. Add to the mix planets orbiting two stars at once and planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a number,\u201d said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. \u201cEach one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u201d\n\nWe do know this: Our galaxy likely holds hundreds of billions of such planets. The steady drumbeat of discovery began in 1992 with strange new worlds orbiting an even stranger star. It was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar, a rapidly spinning stellar corpse that pulses with millisecond bursts of searing radiation. Measuring slight changes in the timing of the pulses allowed scientists to reveal planets in orbit around the pulsar.\n\nFinding just three planets around this spinning star essentially opened the floodgates, said Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system.\n\n\u201cIf you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\u201d Wolszczan said. \u201cThe planet production process has to be very robust.\u201d\n\nWolszczan, who still searches for exoplanets as a professor at Penn State, says we\u2019re opening an era of discovery that will go beyond simply adding new planets to the list. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, continues to make new exoplanet discoveries. But soon powerful next-generation telescopes and their highly sensitive instruments, starting with the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, will capture light from the atmospheres of exoplanets, reading which gases are present to potentially identify tell-tale signs of habitable conditions.\n\nThe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, expected to launch in 2027, will make new exoplanet discoveries using a variety of methods. The ESA (European Space Agency) mission ARIEL, launching in 2029, will observe exoplanet atmospheres; a piece of NASA technology aboard, called CASE, will help zero in on exoplanet clouds and hazes.\n\n\u201cTo my thinking, it is inevitable that we\u2019ll find some kind of life somewhere \u2013 most likely of some primitive kind,\u201d Wolszczan said. The close connection between the chemistry of life on Earth and chemistry found throughout the universe, as well as the detection of widespread organic molecules, suggests detection of life itself is only a matter of time, he added."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nWho Is Julia Kristeva?\n\nJulia Kristeva is a name that often gets bounced around in conversations about contemporary theory and philosophy. But who, exactly, is Kristeva, and why is she so important? Born in Bulgaria in 1941, she moved to France at the age of 23, and here she became a leader in philosophy, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Her writing has encompassed various subjects including sociology, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and art history. She has also published more than 30 books and leading scholarly essays, and been awarded a series of prestigious prizes including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize. Let\u2019s take a look at her life and work in more detail.\n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leader In Semiotics\n\nThroughout her career, Kristeva has pursued the subject of semiotics, or the study of signs, symbols and language. She trained in linguistics at the University of Sofia, before moving to France in the 1960s. In France, Kristeva became a member of the Tel Quel group, a band of French academics who published the literary journal Tel Quel. The journal gave Kristeva a platform to explore ideas around the politics of language. \n\nTwo of Her Most Important Early Publications Explored Semiotics\n\nKristeva\u2019s early work with Tel Quel became the foundation for her first two publications, Semeiotik\u00e8 (1969) and La R\u00e9volution du langage po\u00e9tique (The Revolution of Poetic Language) (1974). These texts drew on Freudian, Lacanian, and Kleinian psychoanalysis, examining how language, culture and ideologies are built out of unconscious body and gender-based dimensions. Further training in psychoanalysis in the 1970s deepened Kristeva\u2019s belief that unconscious emotions and feelings are intertwined with the meaning invested into our forms of communication.\n\n \n\nAfter the Birth of Her Son, Julia Kristeva Became Increasingly Interested In Child Psychology\n\nFollowing the birth of her son in the 1970s, Kristeva began exploring the semiotic link between mother and child. Her iconic text of this period was Pouvoirs de l\u2019horreur (Powers of Horror) (1980/1982), which explored the power struggle between mother and child as the child eventually rejects their mother in order to find themselves. She calls this rejection of the mother \u201cabjection\u201d, and she believed her notion of the abject would come to replay throughout the human\u2019s adult life in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nKristeva Wrote About the Role of Abjection In Adulthood\n\nSome of Kristeva\u2019s most graphic and disturbing writing explains how we experience the \u201cabject\u201d as adults. She outlines the kinds of horrible, unappealing objects, smells or experiences we naturally reject, such as milk-skin, fingernail clippings, dead bodies, human waste and so on... Not the most enjoyable read. But it does give us a fascinating insight into the workings of the human mind, and the way we respond to external stimuli outside our own body. \n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leading Feminist\n\nAmong her many achievements, Kristeva has been recognized as a leader in feminist theory. She has written extensively about women\u2019s bodies, particularly in relation to motherhood, and the role they play as a primal source of rhythm, tone and movement for every human being before it comes into the real world. One of her most important feminist essays is Women\u2019s Time (1979). In this work she argues there are three types of feminism. The first, which seeks universal equality, overlooking any sexual differences. The second phase emphasizes a uniquely feminine language, which she ultimately disregards as impossible, because she believes gender is too diverse to easily categorize. The third phase of Kristeva\u2019s feminism explores multiple identities, suggesting there are as many different kinds of sexualities are there are people. It\u2019s a fascinating theory that is particularly relevant for today\u2019s culture, which has opened up many debates about the complexities of gender, sexuality and identity."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article about an artist in 1 paragraph?\n\nPatterson attended Hertfordshire College of Art and Design and Goldsmiths College between 1985 and 1989. At Goldsmiths he was included in the Freeze Exhibition organized by Damien Hirst, showing two wall text pieces, one simply showing the names Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, the other, The Last Supper Arranged According to the Flat Back Four Formation (Jesus Christ in Goal) showing the names of the Apostles arranged as different football team systems with Jesus in goal.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his work The Great Bear from 1992, an editioned print which reworks the London Underground map. Patterson is taking an order system that exists within the world and applies it to another set of subjects. In this case he switched the names from the stations with names from famous people. Each Line is a different group of people, like actors, philosophers, footballers etc. An edition was purchased by Charles Saatchi and shown in the Sensation exhibition of 1997 which toured London, Berlin and New York. An edition is in the Tate Gallery collection and is currently on display at Tate Britain in London.\n\nPatterson has also created large scale projects such as Cosmic Wallpaper at the University of Warwick, a Wilfred Owen tribute (Maison Foresti\u00e8re), and he also participated in the MoMA's \"The Project Series, 70, Banners I\". The projects goal for each Simon, Shirin Neshat and Xu Bing was to test the ramifications of the written word in their own unique perspective to be display at the Museum\u2019s Fifty-third Street facade flanked by banners bearing MoMA\u2019s logo from 22 November 1999 \u2013 1 May 2000.\nSimon Patterson was a staff member at the Slade School of Fine Art."}

It comes from the Old Norse word \"sk\u00ed\u00f0\" which means to \"split piece of wood or firewood\". Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century. On one foot, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on the other foot for kicking. The underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing.\""}

{"prompt": "Parse the following and provide a synopsis of helpful, honest and harmless - What are Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness?\nWe chose \u2018helpful, honest, and harmless\u2019 as criteria because they are simple and memorable, and seem to capture the majority of what we want from an aligned1\n1\nWe also discuss the HHH specification in relation to our broader understanding of alignment in Appendix E. AI. But these are also subtle and ambiguous criteria, and the best AI behavior will involve a compromise between them. For example, there will clearly be conflicts between helpfulness to the user and harmlessness to others if agents are asked to aid in harmful activities. Here are some very brief notes on these terms:\n\nHelpful:\n\nThe AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as this isn\u2019t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible.\n\nWhen more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion.\n\nIdeally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked \u2018how can I build a website in assembly language\u2019 it might suggest a different approach.\n\nHonest:\n\nAt its most basic level, the AI should give accurate information. Moreover, it should be calibrated (e.g. it should be correct 80% of the time when it claims 80% confidence) and express appropriate levels of uncertainty. It should express its uncertainty without misleading human users.\n\nCrucially, the AI should be honest about its own capabilities and levels of knowledge \u2013 it is not sufficient for it to simply imitate the responses expected from a seemingly humble and honest expert.\n\nIdeally the AI would also be honest about itself and its own internal state, insofar as that information is available to it.\n\nHonesty is more objective than helpfulness and harmlessness. Therefore more aspects of honesty training may be possible without human input. This might include calibration training on factual claims and claims about the internal state of the model, and the use of search to augment accuracy.\n\nHarmless:\n\nThe AI should not be offensive or discriminatory, either directly or through subtext or bias.\n\nWhen asked to aid in a dangerous act (e.g. building a bomb), the AI should politely refuse. Ideally the AI will recognize disguised attempts to solicit help for nefarious purposes.\n\nTo the best of its abilities, the AI should recognize when it may be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care.\n\nWhat behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will vary across people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of the user query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used.\n\nAll of these criteria are at least somewhat subjective, and those who deploy an AI will need to take responsibility for the way that alignment is defined and the extent to which it has been attained."}

At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.[13] The nation consists of the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

{"prompt": "What does this text say that hyenas eat?\n\nThese interesting carnivores live in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. They are able to survive in savannas and swamps, as well as semi-arid regions, and even mountainous forest areas. Rather than resting in dens, adult spotted hyenas sleep in holes or shallow pools or under bushes or scrubs\u2014anywhere they can find shade during the heat of the day. Hyenas use watering holes as places to cool off or to hide extra food. Spotted hyenas can be active both day and night, depending on their needs and whether there are humans around, but they are generally nocturnal.\n\nLions and hyenas compete over the same food in overlapping territories. Sometimes the hyenas do the work of organizing, chasing down, and killing prey only to have lions steal it. Lions often injure or kill hyenas as they fight over a carcass. Both hyenas and lions mark and establish territories, and both species are always on guard. When confronted by a lion, the spotted hyena calls for help from other hyenas.\n\nIn a large group, spotted hyenas are able to chase lions away from a kill. But during a hunt, the hyena's impressive hunting skills come into play. They are able to chase down prey over long distances while running at up to 37 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour). \n\nSpotted hyenas often pick out the young or weak from the herd, but they can kill even healthy adult ungulates. What they hunt depends on numbers. The bigger the hyena clan, the larger its prey. This can include young rhinos, adult wildebeest, zebras, and Cape buffalo. The hyenas work in a group when hunting such large prey, and young hyenas take years to become successful. Smaller packs chase down gazelles, impalas, warthogs, and waterbucks.\n\nWhen hunting alone, a spotted hyena may go after smaller prey. Ground birds, rabbits, springhare, bat-eared foxes, porcupines, jackals, and fish can be on the menu. Even ostrich eggs are fair game! Spotted hyenas also scavenge, but they have to compete with jackals and vultures for these leftovers.\n\nA hyena can eat quite a bit at one time. Sometimes, leftovers are buried in a mud hole for a later meal. Spotted hyenas give new meaning to the phrase \"lick the platter clean.\" They eat practically every part of their prey, including skin, hooves, bone, and teeth. Powerful jaws are able to crush bones with ease. Most other predators couldn\u2019t eat those things, even if they tried. There are some items that hyenas can\u2019t digest, such as hair and horns, although they still eat them."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this synopsis of \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 2 paragraphs or less? \n\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander's wife while singing \"Singin' in the Rain\". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer, PR Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning Alex and leaving him to be arrested. Deltoid brings word that the woman has died of her injuries, and Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is released from prison, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who is now using a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted his wife and him. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping out the window.\n\nAlex survives the attempt and wakes up in hospital with multiple injuries. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\""}

The well built reinforced building with its arched arcades survived both the 1906 and the 1989 earthquakes with little damage. It served as the destination for commuters to San Francisco from the East Bay, who rode the ferry fleets of the Southern Pacific and the Key System. It also served as the connection to San Francisco for the transcontinental rail lines of the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Western Pacific which terminated in Oakland, and for the Northwestern Pacific running north from Marin County. The ferry piers north of the clock tower served the Key System, Santa Fe, and Northwestern Pacific, while the piers south of the tower served the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific.[4] A loop track in front of the building enabled convenient transfers to streetcars. A large pedestrian bridge spanned the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry building to facilitate safe crossing of the busy plaza and transit hub. In the 1940s, the bridge was dismantled to supply scrap metal for the Second World War.\n\nUntil the completion of the Bay Bridge (which began to carry railroad traffic) and Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s, the Ferry Building was the second busiest transit terminal in the world, second only to London's Charing Cross Station. After the bridges opened, and the new Key System and Southern Pacific (Interurban Electric/IER) trains began running to the East Bay from the Transbay Terminal in 1939, passenger ferry use fell sharply. In the second half of the 20th century, although the Ferry Building and its clock tower remained a part of the San Francisco skyline, the condition of the building interior declined with changes. Beginning in the 1950s, unsympathetic renovations installed a mezzanine level, broke up the grand space of the Great Nave, and partitioned the ticketing counters and waiting room areas into office space. The formerly grand public space was reduced to a narrow and dark corridor, through which travelers passed en route to the piers. Passengers were made to wait for ferries on outdoor benches, and the ticketing booths were moved to the pier.[5]\n\n\nEmbaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building, February 1982\nIn the late 1950s, the Embarcadero Freeway was built, which passed right in front of the Ferry Building, and views of the once-prominent landmark were greatly obscured from Market Street. Pedestrian access was treated as an afterthought, and the public was cut off from the waterfront.[5]\n\nMarket Street Railway services terminated at a loop in front of the building prior to the construction of the Transbay Terminal. The last streetcars ran on July 2, 1949.[6]\n\nWith the structural failure of the Embarcadero Freeway during the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco was offered the choice of whether to rebuild it or remove the freeway and reconnect the city with the eastern waterfront and the historic Ferry Building. As part of the larger rejection of the 1950s comprehensive freeway plan as unsympathetic to the city's character, and the general unpopularity of the freeway, Mayor Art Agnos led the charge to remove the Embarcadero freeway entirely. It was replaced with a ground-level boulevard, which reconnected a significant portion of San Francisco's waterfront and the rest of the city. Access was restored to Embarcadero Plaza (previously Justin Herman Plaza) and the foot of Market Street, of which the Ferry Building had been an integral part for so many decades."}

{"prompt": "I want to pass down this recipe for Nilla Wafer Banana Pudding for my daughter. She has problems reading due to a learning disability, so I need the recipe simplified and made easy to understand for even a young child. Can you rewrite the recipe below to meet those requirements? \n\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup granulated sugar, separated\n\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n4 eggs, separated\n\n2 cups milk\n\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n35-45 Nilla Wafers or shortbread cookies\n\n5-6 ripe medium bananas, sliced\n\nDIRECTIONS\nTo make the custard, simmer one to two inches of water in a pot over low heat. Place a glass or metal bowl on top of the pot, making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water.\nAdd 1/2 cup of sugar, flour, and salt to the bowl.\nBeat in the egg yolks and milk, and stir until the mixture is well-combined.\nCook the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the milk from burning.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and mix in the vanilla.\nSpread a small amount of the custard at the bottom of a 1 1/2-quart casserole.\nLayer Nilla Wafers on top of the custard. Top with a layer of sliced bananas.\nPour a third of the custard over the bananas. Continue layering until you get three layers of each component, ending with the custard. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo make the meringue topping, beat the egg whites with a mixer until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. You\u2019ll know the egg whites are done when they\u2019re glossy and they form a firm peak that holds its shape when you lift the beater.\nSpoon over the meringue over the pudding, making sure the entire surface is covered well.\nBake the pudding for 5 minutes or until the meringue has turned light golden brown.\nLet the pudding cool to room temperature. Chill in the fridge before serving.\nGarnish with banana slices and place Nilla Wafers around the edge of the dish."}

Over the course of the decade, she photographed many Indigenous Mexican communities, in some cases living amongst them for extended periods of time, or returning to build strong relationships.\n\nAs her career progressed, Iturbide began to move away from portraits and imagery of humans, and more towards ritual and symbol. Latter pieces of work seem to tap into something uncanny, giving the sense that magic is being performed somewhere nearby, or behind the scenes. Iturbide has described these rituals as \u201cthe only way to forget the everyday\u201d.\n\nTravel was always a major part of the photographer\u2019s work, and it\u2019s reflected in this show, which features images she shot in her home country of Mexico, as well as work from India, Europe, the US and South America.\n\n\u201cI have looked for the surprise in the ordinary, an ordinary that I could find anywhere in the world,\u201d said the photographer, who received the Outstanding Contribution to Photography prize in last year\u2019s Sony World Photography Awards.\n\nThe exhibition features some of Iturbide\u2019s most significant pieces of work to date, including her portraits of the Seri people of the Sonoran Desert, the cholo gangs of LA and Tijuana, and her images of the Zapotec women of Oaxaca \u2013 who she spent ten years visiting.\n\nAs well as examining her historic contribution, Heliotropo 37 unveils a rare colour series by Iturbide, commissioned by the Fondation Cartier and shot in an alabaster and onyx mine in Tecali de Herrera, Mexico. Exhibition-goers can also peer inside Iturbide\u2019s striking terracotta brick-clad Mexico City studio, in a set of images shot by Pablo L\u00f3pez Luz."}

{"prompt": "What does this text say about the new Samsung OLED TV?\n\nSamsung announced the pre-order availability of several flagship TV models shown at CES 2022 earlier this year, but buried at the bottom of its press release were three words that immediately caught my attention: Samsung OLED TV.\n\nThe writeup was rather vague, but after some back and forth, the company confirmed that the Samsung OLED TV (S95B) uses the hugely anticipated QD-OLED screen technology. The naming will likely cause confusion but the idea seems to be that OLED is already a household name, and now Samsung wants people to associate it with its brand, not the Korean rival who has dominated the OLED TV space in recent years.\n\nQD-OLED combines the best of Quantum Dot with the best of OLED to create infinite contrast ratios, perfect black levels, and high brightness levels. You can learn more about the technology in our QD-OLED guide but the short version is that quantum dots sit on a separate layer in front of an OLED one and emit blue light to illuminate pixels that contain red and green quantum dots. Each pixel is essentially converted into three subpixels, covering red, green, and blue, which can be combined to create true white light.\n\nThough it breaks new ground for Samsung, the Samsung OLED TV isn\u2019t the first device with QD-OLED tech. Sony unveiled at CES 2022 its Bravia A95K which also uses QD-OLED and Alienware released a monitor with the same panel tech. It is rather unusual for Samsung to be so coy about what could be one of its most important releases of the year. Whatever the case for that, this is big news for the TV industry.\n\nNow, back to the TV itself. Samsung OLED uses the same Neural Quantum Processor found in the Neo 8K for optimizing upscaled images. It runs on Tizen, an easy-to-navigate proprietary TV OS found on most Samsung sets. The company is also touting the OLED TV\u2019s sound quality, which supports Object Tracking Sound and Dolby Atmos for a surround sound effect and Q-Sympathy for playing audio through your TV and soundbar simultaneously.\n\nOf note is an \u201cOLED brightness booster.\u201d Samsung didn\u2019t provide brightness ratings, but this feature sounds encouraging. One downside of OLED panels is that they don\u2019t get as bright as backlit panels\u2013a flaw QD-OLED should resolve. The new hybrid technology isn\u2019t the only thing that could make you consider upgrading your current TV as the Samsung OLED also supports HDR10+ and has a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nAs for the design, Samsung is calling it \u201cLaserSlim\u201d because it is as thin as a laser beam...I guess? Anyway, the TV does look extremely thin (1.6 inches without the stand) based on the photos Samsung provided. On the rear are four HDMI ports all of which support 4K at 120Hz, which could make this a good option for gaming.\n\nThe Samsung OLED S95B is available for pre-order today in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes, with prices set at $2,399 and $3,499, respectively. Sony\u2019s versions come in the same sizes but pricing has yet to be released."}

This is a wonderful, moving novel set in the Afghanistan of the early 70\u2019s and of today, about a young boy and his friend growing up in Kabul. Amir desperately wants his father\u2019s approval, but Baba is not quick to give it. He is a rich man, brimming with macho vibrancy, while his son is a different sort altogether. Amir is fast friends with Hassan, the son of his father\u2019s servant. They are as close as brothers. But, beset by bullies, an event occurs that changes Amir\u2019s life. There is much death and horror in this portrait of a tortured country. But there is also emotional richness, and a look into the inner life. By the end of the book there was not a dry eye in the house. It is recommended unreservedly. A wonderful tale, movingly told."}

Snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches are forecast for much of the interior Northeast.\n\nModerate to heavy snow has already hit \"a rather large area\" of the eastern U.S., including as much as 8 to 12 inches in the Tennessee Valley and central Appalachia, said National Weather Service meteorologist Andrew Orrison.\n\nStrong winds were reported in southern states \u2014 gusts, possibly a tornado, hit early Saturday in Ocala, a city in central Florida, damaging buildings and homes. More than a hundred thousand power outages were reported from Pennsylvania to Florida midday Saturday, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nThe storm will also bring threats of flooding, hail and possible tornadoes to much of the coastal southeast, according to AccuWeather.\n\nAnd much of the northeast is also expected to see severely reduced visibility and white-out conditions, making road travel \"extremely dangerous at times,\" according to NOAA.\n\nAmid the storm, Route 581 in Pennsylvania was shut down Saturday after 73 vehicles were involved in a crash, Pennsylvania State Police said. Multiple, non-life threatening injuries were reported.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Transportation cautioned residents to stay off roads. \n\nPolice in Charleston, South Carolina also reported high winds causing the container of a truck to fly off and land on a police car. Two bridges also closed. Winds above 60 mph have already been reported in Charleston, according to the local National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral St. Patrick's Day celebrations were cancelled due to weather over the weekend, including in Albany, New York and multiple cities in Pennsylvania. In Knoxville, Tennessee, a St. Patrick's Day parade was cancelled after several inches of snow led to multiple crashes on interstate highways."}

The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign.\n\nThe White House has not said whether Biden supports it. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to say if she supports the measure but said she was reviewing it closely.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said supporters agreed the change would not take place until November 2023 after input from airlines and broadcasters.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,\" Rubio said. \"If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore.\"\n\n\"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come,\" he added.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores opposes the change, telling Congress this month \"we should not have kids going to school in the dark.\"\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\nA man runs near the reflecting pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument at sunrise on the National Mall in Washington\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\n\nSince 2015, about 30 states have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue last week, where Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said, \"The loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nAt the hearing, Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division, argued daylight savings time makes it harder to be alert in the morning, saying it \"is like living in the wrong time zone for almost eight months out of the year.\"\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change. They argue the measure could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nDaylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was used during World War Two and adopted again in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nLisbon: The public transit design utopia\n\nLisbon is a public transit aficionado\u2019s dream. Whether it is the unique Elevador de Santa Justa or the city\u2019s iconic yellow trams, picturesquely winding their way up the steep narrow streets. In this City Snapshot, Dr Chris Hale heads west and argues that Lisbon\u2019s metro should be what puts this ancient city at the forefront of public transit design.\n\nAll cities like to claim to be unique, but there is nowhere else on the planet like Lisbon. Once the seat of a mighty empire, Lisbon retains a sense of grandeur in particular locations and precincts. But the city has clearly mellowed over the past couple of centuries. And is these days more a collection of quirky neighbourhoods.\n\nLisbon offers a much better sense of personal intimacy than other former empire seats such as Berlin, Paris, London, or even Brussels \u2013 all of which feature a threshold number of inhuman vistas and over-scale architectural moments. You can try hard to enjoy Berlin, but you\u2019ll definitely enjoy yourself in Lisbon \u2013 whatever your starting mood, and without trying.\n\nWith a great many steep hills, as well as extensive water frontages, in Lisbon you\u2019re only ever a couple of hundred metres away from a magnificent vista. And once you\u2019ve reached a particular corner of the city, the effort of getting there lends itself to lingering around that place for deeper exploration.\n\nLisbon\u2019s small trams blur the lines between real public transport and a toy train set. Probably with the carrying capacity of the latter, and a similar sense of fun.\n\nBut Lisbon\u2019s more important contribution to world transport concepts comes from its relatively new metro system. It was inaugurated in 1959, initially as a Y-shaped network but has progressively grown since to encompass 56 stations on 4 separate lines to date.\n\nThe latest extension is currently under construction, to close the loop of the Green Line between Rato and Cais do Sodr\u00e9, with two new stations: Estrela and Santos.\n\nThis expansion will also link to other public transport modes, namely Comboios de Portugal\u2019s Lisboa-Cascais line on the national railway network and river ports linking Lisbo, to its south shore neighbouring suburbs across the Tagus River.\n\nCarrying on the theme of \u2018unique neighbourhoods\u2019 \u2013 each station is startlingly unique and startlingly colourful. Station designers have taken relatively straightforward underground box stations, and used colour, lighting, detail, and art to striking effect \u2013 such as Olaias station at the top of this article. Drawing on Lisbon\u2019s penchant for tiled walls, most of the stations get their flavour and colour from a complex and coherent mosaic of multi-coloured tiles.\n\nWhile there have been slow efforts in some international metro and rail systems to brighten up stations and give them more character, Lisbon has definitely set the benchmark.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been lucky to travel and experience a great many rail systems in world cities \u2013 Lisbon\u2019s metro is the most fun, and the least sterile. And in this regard, Lisbon should be the world\u2019s main provenance of rail and metro design cues over the coming decade."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the credit reporting agencies?\n\nThree of the country's largest credit reporting agencies are removing nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports, the companies announced in a joint statement Friday.\n\nEquifax (EFX), Experian (EXPGF) and TransUnion (TRU) will eliminate billions of dollars from the accounts of consumers who faced unexpected medical bills that they were unable to pay. The three firms said they made the move after months of research.\n\"Medical collections debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we're taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal well-being,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\nThe announcement follows research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing that Americans had racked up $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records as of June 2021. It's the most common debt collection credit account on credit records, the CFPB said.\nMedical debt can be volatile and unpredictable, and can negatively affect many financially secure consumers. Black, Hispanic, young and low-income consumers are most likely to be impacted by medical debt, the bureau said.\nMedical debt concerns have heightened since the Covid-19 pandemic hospitalized millions of people, and CFBP Director Rohit Chopra has been publicly critical of medical debt collections by credit reporting agencies. On March 1, Chopra said the CFPD will be \"closely scrutinizing\" the Big Three credit reporting agencies.\n\"We expect them to take seriously their role as major actors in the credit reporting system -- a system whose integrity and accuracy can determine the financial futures of hundreds of millions of people,\" Chopra said.\nStarting July 1, paid medical collection debt will no longer be included on consumer credit reports. Millions of Americans had credit scores previously lowered because debts paid after being sent to collections could appear on credit reports for up to seven years.\nMore changes are expected. It will now take one month before unpaid medical collection debt appears on a consumer's report, instead of six months, the previous standard.\nThe three companies also said that starting in the first half of 2023, medical collection debt less than $500 will no longer be included on credit reports."}

{"prompt": "I was wondering why we don't eat turkey eggs. I assume it has to be because they just don't taste good. Is that what this article says? \"According to the National Turkey Federation, the average American ate 16 pounds of turkey in 2012.  On Thanksgiving alone, it\u2019s estimated Americans consume 46 million turkeys.  And even though turkey eggs are edible and similar in taste to chicken eggs, they aren\u2019t as widely consumed. \n\nThe economics of egg production lend a sizable advantage to producing chicken eggs over turkey eggs.  Patty Fuhs of Turkey Downs, a turkey farm in Montgomery, Ind., says most turkey producers use turkey eggs for producing more turkeys rather than selling the eggs.  She says turkeys are more expensive and require more time to produce eggs, consume twice as much feed and lay one-third as many eggs as chickens. \n\nThe average size of a turkey is 16 to 17 pounds compared to 3 to 4 pounds for an average sized chicken.  A chicken lays approximately 300 eggs per year while the average turkey produces only 100 or so.  Not only do turkeys produce fewer eggs but they also require more time to come into egg production.  Chickens come into production at 19 to 20 weeks, while turkeys require 32 weeks. \n\nTurkeys also tend to go broody easily which could hinder a large scale turkey egg operation.  Broodiness occurs when a bird wants to sit on their eggs and incubate them.  Chickens have broodiness bred out of them and otherwise have no desire to incubate their offspring and be maternal.\n\nCulinary factors also contribute to the dearth of turkey egg consumption.  Turkey eggs have a thicker and tougher shell membrane and are harder to break than chicken eggs.  Furthermore, most recipes are designed for the amount of liquid in a chicken egg.  The weight of a large chicken egg is 50 grams, while the weight of a turkey egg is 80 grams. Such a difference could cause dreadful results in ones pumpkin pie.\n\nFred Schnell of Gobble Development in Birdseye, Ind. whose operation produces male turkeys called toms rather than female egg-laying turkey hens says that some people eat what are called mound oysters from the toms.  Mound oysters are turkey testicles -- different type of egg, says Schnell. \n\nThere are health and regulatory concerns with producing turkey eggs as well.  Feed ingredients can be transferred from a turkey hen to an egg and the USDA must clear these ingredients as safe for human consumption.  And while these ingredients have been cleared for chickens, they have not been cleared for turkeys.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nCarlota Guerrero: the Spanish photographer reframing the female body\nGuerrero has had a meteoric rise since capturing Solange\u2019s album cover in 2016. A new book charts her work to date, exploring her desire to carve out a space of liberation for her female subjects\n\nPhotographer Carlota Guerrero has a vivid memory from her early childhood. In the introduction of her new photobook, she recalls \u201csitting at my desk during school, fantasizing about climbing up on the teacher\u2019s table and taking off my clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers try to stop me, but I flee and run naked like a gazelle, through the corridors, the courtyard of the school and the gymnasium, and through all the public spaces. I feel terribly guilty for having imagined it.\u201d\n\nThis fantasy of escape and liberation remains the central thread of her photography. The self-taught photographer, who is from Barcelona, has been exploring these themes of femininity, body autonomy and exploration for a decade. After being gifted an Olga film camera as a teenager, she started out capturing her friend group\u2019s blissful, naked afternoons by the Mediterranean, and the freedom they felt in each other\u2019s company.\n\nShe credits an LSD trip for furthering this idea of female interconnectedness. \u201cWhen I bring women together in one place and photograph them, I am creating new organisms... as if each woman were an organ or a cell that, by joining the others, makes up a whole being,\u201d she writes.\n\nShe was in her mid-20s when she got her big break. Musician Solange Knowles contacted the then-unknown photographer after seeing her work on Instagram. Guerrero captured the musician in her trademark soft earth tones, hair full of colourful clips to hold the waves of her hair in place, for the cover of her 2016 album Seat at the Table.\n\nIt was a meeting of minds \u2013 Knowles\u2019s wistful, dreamy vision which exposes the awkward hidden details of womanhood dovetailed perfectly with Guerrero\u2019s own offbeat exploration of sensuality and healing. Guerrero would go on to collaborate with Solange on music videos and shoot her next album cover, When I Get Home.\n\nSince her fruitful collaboration with Knowles, Guerrero has become one of the most in-demand photographers working today. She has photographed musicians Arca and Rosalia and the poet Rupi Kaur. She\u2019s worked with fashion royalty, from Helmut Lang to Dior to Philip Lim. During 2019\u2019s Miami Art Basel show, she caused a viral sensation with her performance piece \u201cLove Different\u201d, in partnership with Spanish brand Desigual. The performance ended in a writhing mass of 30 bodies which included Lourdes Leon, Madonna\u2019s daughter.\n\nHer work to date is now collected in Tengo un Dragon Dentro del Corazon: The Photographs of Carlota Guerrero, a new photobook from Prestel, showcasing her distinctive low-contrast tones, seen with a warm and tranquil eye. Guerrero has said in interviews that her aesthetic vision stands in contrast with her own restless, anxious personality. She is also constantly working to see women\u2019s bodies in a different way, from a point of view of joy and camaraderie free from the male gaze.\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, Rupi Kaur recalls a shoot with Guerrero in which she \u201cended up naked in a bed of pink rose petals at her Barcelona studio.\u201d She points out that Guerrero\u2019s fixation on the female body is an attempt to reframe and reclaim them in popular visual culture. It goes beyond representation, even though the women she photographs vary in shape, size and skin tone. Although they tap into a raw sensuality, they are a million miles away from the women offered up for consumption in the pages of magazines Guerrero and her generation grew up seeing.\n\n\u201cCarlota\u2019s work is the antidote to our male-gaze problem,\u201d Kaur writes. \u201cIn an industry dominated by men shooting women\u2019s bodies, Carlota\u2019s vision is refreshing. As a woman, I\u2019m not interested in looking at my body through the eyes of a man anymore. I\u2019ve done that my whole life. I want to see and be shot by a woman whose images are celebrative, not exploitative. Sexy, not voyeuristic. In a world where the feminine is violated, the femininity that Carlota captures is honest and empowering.\u201d"}

His ultimate destination ended up shocking the football world.\n\nMiller is headed to Buffalo to join the Bills on a six-year, $120 million deal, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday. The contract includes an average of $17.5 million per year for the first four seasons and $51 million in guarantees, per Rapoport.\n\nMiller's courting came on the heels of the edge rusher winning his second Super Bowl and first as a member of the Los Angeles Rams, who were expected to make a strong push to keep him and make another run at a title in 2022. Los Angeles did not give up through Wednesday, with coach Sean McVay emotionally appealing to Miller to stay, per Rapoport. But Buffalo's quiet work on Miller, which took up the entire day, ended up winning out.\""}

And officials said the student affairs office plans to tap experts to brainstorm measures beyond clinical support. Over the last two years, Stanford increased its clinical staff by 20%, which officials said reduced wait times for those seeking services.\n\nThe move comes as students increasingly seek therapy and other wellness services on campus \u2014 a trend that saw a sharp spike during the pandemic. And there's evidence suicide attempts are increasing among young people. Meanwhile, colleges and universities are struggling to keep up with demand because of a shortage in mental health clinicians, California Healthline reports.\n\n\"Mental health remains not only an ongoing challenge but our most urgent priority,\" wrote Dee Mostofi, a spokesperson for the university, in an email.\n\nStanford officials said recent losses \"can feel especially overwhelming\" amid the ongoing pandemic and outbreak of war in Ukraine, and urged those struggling emotionally to reach out for help.\n\n\"For all in our community who are suffering, know that whatever feelings are arising in you are normal and need time to be felt,\" officials added. \"There\u2019s no one way or right way to grieve, and we are here to support each other as we find our own paths to healing.\"\n\nCan you summarize this with 2 bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nLisbon: The public transit design utopia\n\nLisbon is a public transit aficionado\u2019s dream. Whether it is the unique Elevador de Santa Justa or the city\u2019s iconic yellow trams, picturesquely winding their way up the steep narrow streets. In this City Snapshot, Dr Chris Hale heads west and argues that Lisbon\u2019s metro should be what puts this ancient city at the forefront of public transit design.\n\nAll cities like to claim to be unique, but there is nowhere else on the planet like Lisbon. Once the seat of a mighty empire, Lisbon retains a sense of grandeur in particular locations and precincts. But the city has clearly mellowed over the past couple of centuries. And is these days more a collection of quirky neighbourhoods.\n\nLisbon offers a much better sense of personal intimacy than other former empire seats such as Berlin, Paris, London, or even Brussels \u2013 all of which feature a threshold number of inhuman vistas and over-scale architectural moments. You can try hard to enjoy Berlin, but you\u2019ll definitely enjoy yourself in Lisbon \u2013 whatever your starting mood, and without trying.\n\nWith a great many steep hills, as well as extensive water frontages, in Lisbon you\u2019re only ever a couple of hundred metres away from a magnificent vista. And once you\u2019ve reached a particular corner of the city, the effort of getting there lends itself to lingering around that place for deeper exploration.\n\nLisbon\u2019s small trams blur the lines between real public transport and a toy train set. Probably with the carrying capacity of the latter, and a similar sense of fun.\n\nBut Lisbon\u2019s more important contribution to world transport concepts comes from its relatively new metro system. It was inaugurated in 1959, initially as a Y-shaped network but has progressively grown since to encompass 56 stations on 4 separate lines to date.\n\nThe latest extension is currently under construction, to close the loop of the Green Line between Rato and Cais do Sodr\u00e9, with two new stations: Estrela and Santos.\n\nThis expansion will also link to other public transport modes, namely Comboios de Portugal\u2019s Lisboa-Cascais line on the national railway network and river ports linking Lisbo, to its south shore neighbouring suburbs across the Tagus River.\n\nCarrying on the theme of \u2018unique neighbourhoods\u2019 \u2013 each station is startlingly unique and startlingly colourful. Station designers have taken relatively straightforward underground box stations, and used colour, lighting, detail, and art to striking effect \u2013 such as Olaias station at the top of this article. Drawing on Lisbon\u2019s penchant for tiled walls, most of the stations get their flavour and colour from a complex and coherent mosaic of multi-coloured tiles.\n\nWhile there have been slow efforts in some international metro and rail systems to brighten up stations and give them more character, Lisbon has definitely set the benchmark.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been lucky to travel and experience a great many rail systems in world cities \u2013 Lisbon\u2019s metro is the most fun, and the least sterile. And in this regard, Lisbon should be the world\u2019s main provenance of rail and metro design cues over the coming decade."}

{"prompt": "Can you edit this in the style of a New York Times article? To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature, winning the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.\n\nDespite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, \"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\"[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \"every adult should read before they die\".[3]"}

The three firms said they made the move after months of research.\n\"Medical collections debt often arises from unforeseen medical circumstances. These changes are another step we're taking together to help people across the United States focus on their financial and personal well-being,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\nThe announcement follows research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing that Americans had racked up $88 billion in medical debt on consumer credit records as of June 2021. It's the most common debt collection credit account on credit records, the CFPB said.\nMedical debt can be volatile and unpredictable, and can negatively affect many financially secure consumers. Black, Hispanic, young and low-income consumers are most likely to be impacted by medical debt, the bureau said.\nMedical debt concerns have heightened since the Covid-19 pandemic hospitalized millions of people, and CFBP Director Rohit Chopra has been publicly critical of medical debt collections by credit reporting agencies. On March 1, Chopra said the CFPD will be \"closely scrutinizing\" the Big Three credit reporting agencies.\n\"We expect them to take seriously their role as major actors in the credit reporting system -- a system whose integrity and accuracy can determine the financial futures of hundreds of millions of people,\" Chopra said.\nStarting July 1, paid medical collection debt will no longer be included on consumer credit reports. Millions of Americans had credit scores previously lowered because debts paid after being sent to collections could appear on credit reports for up to seven years.\nMore changes are expected. It will now take one month before unpaid medical collection debt appears on a consumer's report, instead of six months, the previous standard.\nThe three companies also said that starting in the first half of 2023, medical collection debt less than $500 will no longer be included on credit reports."}

What transpired afterward was a contentious exchange that unfolded on live television.\n\nViktor Hovland, who was paired with Berger, immediately pushed back on Berger\u2019s attempted drop just short of the green. \u201cI don\u2019t think it crossed up there,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got it on camera. We can take a look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can call a rules official and a camera,\u201d Berger countered.\n\nJoel Dahmen, the third member of the group, agreed with Hovland and a surprisingly heated debate ensued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take a drop that I don\u2019t feel 100% correct about. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s all the way up there [by the green], but it\u2019s not back there [motioning toward the spot Dahmen and Hovland were contending his golf ball crossed into the hazard],\u201d Berger argued.\n\nCan you summarize this into 2 bullet points please?"}

I don't understand some of the terminology. \"The latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and \u201cparalyze\u201d the assets of Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cThe ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,\u201d wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\nPutin\u2019s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his \u201cfortress\u201d economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n\u201cWe will ... ban the transactions of Russia\u2019s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin\u2019s war,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its \u201crainy day fund,\u201d senior US administration officials said.\n\n\u201cOur strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia\u2019s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n\u201cExternal conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,\u201d the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. \u201cThis is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,\u201d the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports \u2014 including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia\u2019s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cSo there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.\u201d\n\nA run on the banks\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions target Russia\u2019s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia\u2019s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,\u201d the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,\u201d it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. \n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of \u201csignificant deposit outflows\u201d triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\u201cThis led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,\u201d the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%. Other Russian companies with foreign listings were also hammered. Gas giant Gazprom (GZPFY) dropped 37% in London trading. Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles \u2014 a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets. The government had also ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents outside of Russia from March 1, Reuters reported.'"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary about removing a wasp's nest based on this article?\n\nEnsure that you are not allergic to wasp stings. If you're not sure whether you have an allergy to wasp stings or not, it's a good idea to set up an allergy test with your doctor before you attempt to tackle the nest.\nIf the test confirms that you are not allergic to stings, then you can proceed with getting rid of the nest by yourself.\nHowever, if you find out that you do have an allergy, you absolutely should ask someone else to deal with the nest or call an exterminator, as getting stung could be a life-threatening situation.\nContact your local vector control district. Though not available everywhere, vector control deals with disease-carrying or potentially dangerous insects and animals (vectors). These professionals can help you with identification, advise you on what to do, and may even remove the wasps for you.\nDo a quick internet search for \"vector control\" in your area to find contact information and request service.\nCall an exterminator. In most situations, it's best to leave nest removal to the professionals. If there is no vector control district or they are unable to come remove the nest, try an exterminator instead. This is especially true if you have ground-nesting yellow jackets.\nIf the wasp nest is in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, such as inside a wall or attic or underneath a concrete slab, you will definitely want help from a professional.\nIt is also advisable to call a professional exterminator if you are allergic to wasp stings, as getting rid of the nest by yourself could be dangerous. In fact, even if you aren't allergic, approaching a wasp's nest can be incredibly dangerous and, in fact, deadly if things go wrong.\nConsider leaving the nest alone. If the wasps' nest is far enough away from your house that it doesn't pose a significant threat, you should consider leaving it alone, especially if it belongs to a less aggressive wasp species such as the paper wasp. Wasps are an important part of the ecosystem, as they pollinate plants and flowers and eat other garden pests such as caterpillars.\nWear protective clothing. It's very important to wear protective clothing when you attempt to get rid of a wasp's nest, to prevent getting stung. Even if you're not allergic, a wasp sting can be painful!\nWear long jeans, socks and boots, a sweater with the hood pulled over your head and gloves.\nYou should also wrap a scarf around the lower half of your face and wear protective glasses or ski goggles.\nIf you are using a pesticide spray, make sure the clothes are old, as residue from the spray could enter the fabric. You should wash or discard the clothes immediately afterwards.\nIf you do happen to get stung while getting rid of the nest, see treatment instructions here.\nNever stand on a ladder to reach a high wasps' nest. If the wasps' nest is somewhere up high, like the eave of a two-story house or a high tree branch, do not use a ladder to attempt to reach it.\nIf you are standing on a ladder and a swarm of wasps flies at you when you disturb the nest, you are very likely to fall and seriously injure yourself.\nIn this situation it is best to call a professional exterminator or use something like the smoke method (see below) to get rid of the wasps.\nYou should only attempt to get rid of a wasps' nest by yourself when it is within easy reach."}
{"prompt": "When was this movie filmed - Captain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.\n\nDevelopment of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in Captain Marvel, including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel, The Marvels, is scheduled for release on February 17, 2023."}

{"prompt": "The title of this article is titled \"The Food at Subway isn't what you think it is\" What does the article actually say about it? \"Despite some recent struggles, Subway remains a giant in the fast food world. With nearly 24,000 locations, it is the largest restaurant chain in the country, and it brings in billions of dollars in revenue each year. But with great power comes great responsibility, and Subway has not always lived up to its end of the bargain. In particular, the chain hasn't always delivered to its customers the food they think they are getting.\n\nNearly every aspect of a Subway sandwich \u2014 the meat, the vegetables, and even the bread \u2014 has come under scrutiny for not being what the restaurant claims it to be. In some instances, the company has acknowledged its faults and corrected the problem. Other times, Subway has been defiant and pushed back against accusations. So whether it's getting cheated out of an extra inch of sandwich, eating bread filled with unpronounceable ingredients, or devouring tuna that might not actually be tuna, here are a few examples of food at Subway that isn't really what you think it is. Subway is no stranger to the accusation that it serves mystery meat. Not too long ago, a Canadian news outlet conducted DNA analysis on the sandwich maker's chicken to find that the meat was, in fact, only 50 percent chicken. Subway's latest protein controversy centers on the chicken of the sea. A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleges that Subway's tuna is not tuna at all. The lawsuit states that the ingredient is \"a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a restaurant passed off one fish for another. But the most troubling part of this new allegation is the claim that what Subway is calling \"tuna\" isn't a cheaper fish substitute. Speaking with The Washington Post, an attorney for the plaintiffs claimed lab tests showed the ingredients were \"not fish,\" declining to say what precisely what they found to be were. This makes one former employee's claim that the tuna salad was one bag of tuna and three bags of mayonnaise look like an upgrade.\n\nSubway denied the allegations, but the plaintiffs are still suing for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and other claims, arguing they \"were tricked into buying food items that wholly lacked the ingredients they reasonably thought they were purchasing.\"\n\nOverseas, a court ruled Subway's bread didn't qualify as actual bread\n\nSubway received a particularly humbling piece of news in late 2020 when Ireland's Supreme Court ruled that the restaurant's bread was, believe it or not, not actually bread \u2013 at least in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe problem, according to the court, is the amount of sugar Subway includes in its bread recipe. Ireland's Value-Added Tax Act allows \"staple\" foods, including bread, to be exempt from certain taxes. But the law only allows bread's sugar to be a maximum of 2 percent of the weight of flour, otherwise it's more of a pastry. Not only does Subway's bread recipe have more than the allotted sugar amount, it has five times more.\n\nThe case was brought to the court by an Irish franchisee who was hoping to get a tax refund. It clearly did not work out in their favor. The franchisor was none too pleased either, pushing back against the ruling \u2014 without arguing the court's reasoning. They issued a statement, saying \"Subway's bread is, of course, bread. We have been baking fresh bread in our restaurants for more than three decades and our guests return each day for sandwiches made on bread that smells as good as it tastes.\"\n\nSubway's food is not as healthy as it seems\n\nSubway was able to establish itself as one of the quick-service restaurant giants by promoting itself as the healthier alternative to traditional fast food. But the healthy reputation isn't entirely accurate.\n\nIn general, Subway does offer a wider array of healthier options than the average burger joint. But you need to be careful what you order, and what you're adding on to that order. Although many sandwiches are low in things like sugar, they often have bloated fat and sodium levels. And the restaurant does its best to hide this, as one former employee explained. \"When you walk into a Subway store, you'll see all of our menus have the calories listed with each sandwich ... What you can't read is the small print on the menu, which specifies that these values are only for a six-inch sub, on 'standard recipe' (nobody knows what the [heck] that is) white bread, with no cheese or sauce.\"\n\nTherefore, you can easily be tricked into thinking you're getting a low-fat, low-calorie sandwich. But if you're ordering a foot-long sandwich with cheese and sauce (which 99 percent of the customers do, according to the employee), you're roughly tripling those numbers.\""}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about colloidal silver for me in a few bullet points?\n\nMany consider colloidal silver an antiseptic and not an antibiotic because it kills more than bacteria; it destroys viruses and eliminates fungal infections. So far, bacteria that are resistant to silver haven\u2019t developed, while colloidal silver can destroy antibiotic-resistant pathogens, even the dreaded MRSA.\n\nAs a matter of fact, now the medical mafia has been covertly adding colloidal silver into antibiotics to conquer the super-bug strains that have developed immunity to those antibiotics. I say covertly because they aren\u2019t talking too much about it!\n\nKeep in mind that while antibiotics don\u2019t touch viruses and fungus\u2019s, colloidal silver eliminates them \u2013 making colloidal silver benefits incredibly useful. It eliminates anaerobic pathogens by destroying the enzymes that fend off oxygen molecules, thus oxidizing them to death.\n\nConversely, the silver nano-particles neutralize the minority of aerobic pathogens by disrupting their ability to use oxygen. This begs the question: will colloidal silver destroy friendly gut bacteria the way pharmaceutical antibiotics do? Some colloidal silver advocates claim it is so readily assimilated into the blood through the stomach and gut linings before it can linger in the lower intestines where our friendly bacteria mostly reside. Therefore,  it isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nOthers consider electrical charge bonding as the main factor for eliminating pathogens while sparing gut friendly bacteria. Most friendly bacteria are not negatively charged, eliminating any attraction to the positively charged silver particles.\n\nHowever, a couple of key colloidal advocates, one from whom I purchased my colloidal silver making machine, don\u2019t think that the intestinal flora issue has been clearly established. They recommend the following:\n\nHave probiotic materials on hand and use them an hour or more after ingesting colloidal silver.\nSwish and hold a dose of colloidal silver in your mouth to absorb most of the particles sublingually into the bloodstream through the capillaries under and around your tongue as long as possible before swallowing.\nNebulize the colloidal silver solution, making it go directly into your bloodstream via the lungs blood vessels.\nAs magnetic scavengers, they don\u2019t have to collide into pathogens by chance the way antibiotics do. Because the tiny colloidal silver particles (colloids) have strong positive charges, they are attracted to or attract negatively charged microbes, including viruses."}

LONDON \u2014 Seventy years ago this weekend, a young English princess climbed into Treetops, a remote game-viewing lodge in Kenya, built into the limbs of a fig tree overlooking an elephant watering hole. The next morning, she came down as a queen, though she only learned of the death of her father, George VI, later that day.\n\nThe 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s accession to the throne will be a good deal more earthbound: The 95-year-old monarch plans to spend a quiet Sunday at her country estate, Sandringham, where her father died on Feb. 6, 1952. Four days of festivities to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee are scheduled for June.\n\nBut tributes to the queen poured in from Britain\u2019s great, good and merely prominent. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, told the BBC, \u201cShe takes her duties seriously, but she doesn\u2019t take herself very seriously.\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised her for her \u201cinspirational sense of duty and unwavering dedication to this nation.\u201d\n\nThose words, from a scandal-scarred leader whose tenure in office might be measured in days rather than decades, were testimony not only to the queen\u2019s longevity but also to her immutability. In a country that lurched from the storms of Brexit into the siege of the pandemic, she has been an unmatched anchor of stability."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article entry? On August 13, 2008, California Assembly Bill 3034 (AB 3034) was approved by the state legislature and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on August 26, 2008.[14] The bill was submitted to California voters in the November 2008 election as Proposition 1A and approved.[15] With the voter's mandate, AB 3034 specified certain route and travel time requirements. Among these were that the route must link downtown San Francisco with Los Angeles and Anaheim and must link the state's major population centers together, \"including Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, [the] Los Angeles Basin, the Inland Empire, Orange County, and San Diego.\" The first phase of the project must link San Francisco with Los Angeles and Anaheim. Up to 24 stations were authorized for the completed system.[16]\n\nThis system was scheduled be built in two phases. Phase 1 was to be approximately 520 miles (840 km) long, with completion expected in 2029. Phase 1 would connect the downtowns of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Anaheim using high-speed rail through the Central Valley.[17] In Phase 2, the route was planned to be extended north from the Central Valley to Sacramento and east from Los Angeles through the Inland Empire and then south to San Diego. Upon completion the total system length would have been approximately 800 miles (1,300 km).\n\nOn February 18, 2016, the Rail Authority released its 2016 Draft Business Plan,[18] which significantly altered its near-term plans for the system implementation. While construction was always intended to begin in the Central Valley, the Initial Operating Section (IOS) has always had two options: extend from the Central Valley northward toward the Bay Area (the IOS-North, San Jose to Bakersfield), or southward to Southern California (IOS-South, Merced to San Fernando Valley). In the 2012 and 2014 Business Plans the goal was to implement the IOS-South, but a 2016 analysis of the funding available and time necessary to bring an IOS online the rail authority proposes the IOS-North be implemented instead. The proposal, named the Silicon Valley to Central Valley Line, is expected that sufficient funding will be available to bring this segment online by 2025.[19] The rail authority state its commitment to pursue additional funding to complete the Phase 1 system by 2029.[19]\n\nThe updated business plan also reduced the cost of the system from US$67.6 billion to US$64.2 billion for Phase 1; this included a savings of US$5.5 billion based on actual experience, improved plans, and other feedback, but also an additional US$2.1 billion cost for improvements to the Los Angeles to Anaheim corridor.[20] The 2016 Business Plan estimated the cost to completion of the Silicon Valley to Central Valley line was US$20.6 billion.[21] The public had 60 days, from February 19, 2016, to submit comments on the Draft 2016 Business Plan to the rail authority. The plan was adopted by the rail authority in April 2016, and submitted by legal requirement to the California State Legislature on May 1, 2016.[19]\n\nThe Initial Construction Segment (ICS) of high-speed tracks runs from Merced to Bakersfield in the Central Valley. Simultaneously with the ICS construction, there are \"bookend\" and connectivity investments[22] including electrification of the San Francisco Peninsula Corridor used by Caltrain, improvements to tracks and signaling for both Metrolink in the LA area and Caltrain, and better passenger interconnections for Caltrain, Amtrak, and other Northern California rail lines."}

{"prompt": "Forty years ago, Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash while on tour with Ozzy Osbourne in Florida. The classically trained metal guitarist was only 25 years old when he died, and had only come onto the scene recently as the guitarist and co-songwriter for Osbourne's first two solo albums. Yet he left behind an incredible, indelible legacy thanks to his lightning-speed, virtuosic soloing, which helped define the \u201880s metal sound and influenced guitarists for decades to come. In fact, just last year, Rhoads was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRhoads\u2019s pal Rudy Sarzo, who played with the legend in the late-\u201870s, pre-fame Quiet Riot lineup and was recruited by Rhoads to play bass for Osbourne in 1981 \u2014 and was present at the crash and nearly boarded the plane that day \u2014 has had a major part in keeping his late bandmate\u2019s legacy alive for decades. He even wrote a book, Off the Rails: Aboard the Crazy Train in the Blizzard of Ozz about his bond with the guitar god.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I wrote the book,\u201d Sarzo tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cI wrote it because I have to go back. Sometimes I go back as a spectator, and that way, I avoid feeling the pain again. I go back and I actually see myself in the place at the moment, but I'm disconnected from it, because it\u2019s like I'm watching myself go through this. But for this [Yahoo interview], I had to go in as myself, rather than as a witness. But it is my choice to do that \u2014 because it is very important that I am able to convey the emotion of what happened that day.\u201d\n\nCan you summarize this in a professional and concise way?"}
{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary of this text?\n\nAfter nearly a year of operations, NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars helicopter is still \u201cas good as new\u201d as it serves as a scout for the Perseverance rover.\n\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced March 11 that Ingenuity completed its 21st flight on the planet, traveling 370 meters during the 129-second flight. The helicopter has now traveled more than 4.6 kilometers since its first flight in April 2021.\n\nIngenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, with an original plan of no more than five flights over a month. The excellent performance of the 1.8-kilogram helicopter, though, led NASA to extend its mission, using it as a scout to examine terrain ahead of the Perseverance rover that carried Ingenuity to Mars.\n\nThe information Ingenuity has provided has created some modest time savings for Perseverance. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly shaved several sols, maybe a week, off of the time frame of the rover by having this advanced information,\u201d said Matt Golombek, a senior research scientist at JPL who has been involved with Mars landers dating back to Mars Pathfinder, during a March 8 media briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference. A sol is a Martian day, about 40 minutes longer than a terrestrial day.\n\nOther scientists involved with Perseverance agreed that Ingenuity has been useful. \u201cI was really impressed with how well it worked and how useful it\u2019s been,\u201d said Justin Simon, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center who works on the Perseverance mission, during a conference session March 7. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was fully anticipated, at least by myself.\u201d\n\nKeyron Hickman-Lewis of the U.K.\u2019s Natural History Museum, another Perseverance scientist, said at that conference session that Ingenuity has been particularly helpful as Perseverance negotiated a region called S\u00e9\u00edtah. \u201cThe terrain is not optimal for a rover,\u201d he said of the region. \u201cThese insights have been invaluable.\u201d\n\nThat work will continue as Perseverance heads in the coming weeks to the remnants of a river delta. \u201cThe intent is to keep the helicopter out in front of the rover to provide advance information that would help in its exploration,\u201d Golombek said. That includes scouting paths the rover could take into the delta and identifying rocks for the rover to study with its instrument suite.\n\nIngenuity itself has shown no signs of wear and tear after nearly a year of flying on Mars. \u201cSo far, we have found no degradation or loss of anything on the helicopter. It is as good as new,\u201d he said.\n\nThe helicopter, which uses solar power, also has no consumables to limit its life. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing consumable and nothing to stop us from continuing to operate as long as the helicopter remains healthy,\u201d he said, with the expectation Ingenuity will continue operations until something finally breaks.\n\nThat performance is all the more noteworthy, he added, because of the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts that had been previously qualified for space on Ingenuity, rather than customized components. \u201cIt is rather remarkable that we\u2019ve had no degradation or loss of any aspect of the helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\nGolombek said the performance of Ingenuity demonstrates how useful such helicopters could be in future exploration, although NASA has no firm plans currently for additional helicopter missions. \u201cThe idea of a technology demo is to demonstrate that here is a new way to explore Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cIngenuity has shown the promise of this sort of way to continue our exploration of the red planet.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "A 13-year-old was driving the pickup truck that struck a van in West Texas in a fiery collision that killed nine people, including six members of a college golf team and their coach, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Thursday.\n\nThe child and a man traveling in the truck also died.\n\nThe truck\u2019s left front tire, which was a spare tire, also blew out before impact, said NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg.\n\nAlthough it was unclear how fast the two vehicles were traveling, \u201cthis was clearly a high-speed collision,\u201d Landsberg said. He added investigators hoped to retrieve enough information from the vehicle\u2019s recorders to better understand what happened.\n\nOne must be 14 in Texas to start taking classroom courses for a learner\u2019s license and 15 to receive that provisional license to drive with an instructor or licensed adult in the vehicle. Department of Public Safety Sgt. Victor Taylor said a 13-year-old driving would be breaking the law.\n\nThe pickup truck crossed into the opposite lane on a darkened, two-lane highway before colliding head-on with a van, killing the boy, a man traveling with him, six New Mexico college students and a golf coach.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for people in rural parts of the U.S. to learn to drive when they\u2019re young. But the news that a 13-year-old was behind the wheel in the Texas crash put a renewed focus on the practice.\n\nThe University of the Southwest students, including one from Portugal and one from Mexico, and the coach were returning from a golf tournament when the vehicles collided Tuesday night. Two Canadian students were hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nThe NTSB sent an investigative team to the crash site in Texas\u2019 Andrews County, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of the New Mexico state line. While the area is rural, its roads can often be busy with traffic related to agriculture and oil and gas development.\n\nUniversity of the Southwest spokeswoman Maria Duarte declined to comment on the NTSB\u2019s announcement about the young driver, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe golf teams were traveling in a 2017 Ford Transit van that was towing a box trailer when it collided with the truck, and both vehicles burst into flames, according to NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss.\n\nHe said the vehicles crashed on a two-lane asphalt highway where the speed limit is 75 mph (120 kph), though investigators have not yet determined how fast either vehicle was traveling.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety identified the deceased as: Golf coach Tyler James, 26, of Hobbs, New Mexico; and players Mauricio Sanchez, 19, of Mexico; Travis Garcia, 19, of Pleasanton, Texas; Jackson Zinn, 22, of Westminster, Colorado; Karisa Raines, 21, of Fort Stockton, Texas; Laci Stone, 18, of Nocona, Texas; and Tiago Sousa, 18, of Portugal.\n\nAlso killed were Henrich Siemens, 38, of Seminole County, Texas, and the unidentified 13-year-old boy who were in the 2007 Dodge 2500 pickup.\n\nCritically injured aboard the van were Canadian students Dayton Price, 19, of Mississauga, Ontario, and Hayden Underhill, 20, of Amherstview, Ontario. Both were taken by helicopter to the University Medical Center in Lubbock, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the northeast.\n\n\u201cThey are both stable and recovering and every day making more and more progress,\u201d University of the Southwest Provost Ryan Tipton said Thursday of the two injured students.\n\n\u201cOne of the students is eating chicken soup,\u201d said Tipton, calling their recovery \u201ca game of inches.\u201d\n\nTipton said University President Quint Thurman visited the students\u2019 parents at the hospital, illustrating the close community at the college with only about 350 on-campus students.\n\nUnderhill\u2019s brother Drew said their parents, Ken and Wendy, flew to Texas.\n\n\u201cHockey was a big part of life for a while, but his true passion is golf,\u201d Drew Underhill said.\n\nOn Thursday evening, about 150 people turned out to remember Zinn at Texas Roadhouse, a Hobbs restaurant where he worked and met his girlfriend of five months.\n\n\u201cWe met here exactly at this table,\u201d said Maddy Russell, 20, of Hobbs. \u201cHe was my heart.\u201d\n\nThe mourners released around 100 blue and orange balloons into the cold, whipping wind of eastern New Mexico, and they soon disappeared into the horizon.\n\nThe Mexican Federation of Golf posted an online note of condolence to the loved ones of Sanchez.\n\nSousa was from Portugal's southern coast, where he graduated from high school last summer before heading to college in the U.S., said Renata Afonso, head of the Escola Secund\u00e1ria de Loul\u00e9.\n\n\"Any school would be delighted to have had him as a student,\u201d she said.\n\nTeam member Jasmin Collum had been scheduled to play but at the last minute decided instead to visit her parents in Houston, her mother said.\n\n\u201cWe knew all those people on board,\u201d Tonya Collum said. \"Basically the whole team is gone or in the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe University of the Southwest is a private, Christian college in Hobbs, New Mexico, near the state line with Texas.\nCan you summarize this into 2 bullet points for me please?"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this information on a charities project: Agriculture\nMarket-oriented agricultural development\nA number of Mercy Corps' agriculture-related programs are jointly delivered with objectives in other areas such as water conservation, disaster resilience, emergency crisis response and market system development. For example, Mercy Corps establishes partnerships with local farmers or agribusinesses to stimulate local market exchanges in Uganda, with the ultimate target to not only help farmers gain market competitiveness, but also make affordable food choices more accessible for local populations living in deprived conditions, including incoming refugees within Uganda and from neighboring countries in crisis.[26] In response to the food crisis of the mid-1990s and at the request of North Korea, Mercy Corps began their work in 1996 focusing in the areas of local agricultural development. Throughout the duration of its presence, Mercy Corps has moved from food assistance to working on long-term agricultural and economic solutions: apple trees and fish farms and cross-cultural exchange. The effort involves aid workers living in Pyongyang, and in Chagang and North Pyongan provinces to visit families, monitor distribution and assess impact.[27]\n\nMercy Corps offers a number of agriculture-oriented programs in various countries, often delivered with water conservation and disaster prevention focuses. In Timor-Leste, for example, Mercy Corps seeks to build \"market-based incentives to mitigation activities\" so that local farmers are able to exercise different types of farming practices with different weather-resistance characteristics. By providing them with seed and farming assistance, these practices can enable Timorese farmers to contribute more \"nutritious food source to households and to local markets\" all the while diversifying farming practices so that \"communities are not so reliant on one or two key crops for income and nutrition.\"[28] In Syria since 2011, it has been supporting an estimate of 9,000 local farmers and small gardeners by providing technical assistance in seasonal planting to mitigate with not only natural weather conditions but also man-made humanitarian crises on the ground. The organization purchases seeds for local farmers to reduce the investment cost of crop production in the post-Syrian war environment with destroyed infrastructure, and provide technical and business training that teach farmers efficient ways of planting and cultivation, as well as exchanging surplus productions in local markets.[29]\n\nFood security\nLike most of its other development programs, Mercy Corps work to \"provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives to support resilient well-being.\" With regards to food security, it targets five main areas for development: Pro-Poor Markets, Empowerment, Good Governance, Human Well-Being, and Economic Health.[30] It has been maintaining the main aim to providing its beneficiary population with necessary tools (both technical and material) and assisting them with utilizing these particular tools for the advancement of their own well-being.\n\nIn Niger, Mercy Corps jointly delivered the \"Sawki\" Program with Africare and Helen Keller International.[31] The program, funded by USAID, aimed to respond to the food security needs of a reported 118,000 people in the most vulnerable regions of the country, including Maradi and Zinder. Understanding that 60% of the marginalized population in the program's target areas were children of severe malnutrition, the program sought to \" bring together complementary activities in nutrition, health, agriculture, livestock husbandry, livelihoods promotion, and market development,\" with an emphasized focal point on the empowerment of adolescent girls.[32]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mercy Corps has delivered a SECURE program in Timor-Leste that seeks to relieve and prevent agriculture related damages caused by extreme rainfalls by connecting local blacksmiths who are able to produce effective small and medium-sized metal silos to broader rural farming populations. In collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Mercy Corps provided local farmers with subsidies for local farmers to purchase silos, while the FAO provided training and material assistance for blacksmiths to produce.[33][34]\n\nMercy Corps has also been operating in post-conflict Uganda since 2009: as the state approaches societal recovery, it has been facing a range of development challenges, one of which being the production under-capacity of the farming sector. The Revitalizing Agricultural Incomes and New markets (RAIN) program was created to target key areas that are detrimental for long-term assurance of food security, including financial services for small and medium agro-businesses at the local level, advising larger food-related enterprises for agricultural investment opportunities at the regional and national level, and technical training for returning farmers at the individual level. In parallel of training programs for the farmer communities that seek to improve land-capacity, growth and cultivation capacity and production efficiency, Mercy Corps has also been facilitating various actors within the domestic market chain to promote better access and more extensive availability of financial services and market platforms to ensure the continuous operation of the agricultural supply and demand chains, with the broader objective to encourage sustainable food security.[35]"}

{"prompt": "What kind of spider is mentioned in this article?\n\nNew research, published Feb. 17 in the journal Physiological Entomology, suggests that the palm-sized Joro spider, which swarmed North Georgia by the millions last September, has a special resilience to the cold.\n\nThis has led scientists to suggest that the 3-inch (7.6 centimeters) bright-yellow-striped spiders \u2014 whose hatchlings disperse by fashioning web parachutes to fly as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) \u2014 could soon dominate the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\u201cPeople should try to learn to live with them,\u201d lead author Andy Davis, a research scientist at the University of Georgia, said in a statement. \u201cIf they\u2018re literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they\u2018re just going to be back next year.\u201d\n\nSince the spider hitchhiked its way to the northeast of Atlanta, Georgia, inside a shipping container in 2014, its numbers and range have expanded steadily across Georgia, culminating in an astonishing population boom last year that saw millions of the arachnids drape porches, power lines, mailboxes and vegetable patches across more than 25 state counties with webs as thick as 10 feet (3 meters) deep, Live Science previously reported.\n\nCommon to China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, the Joro spider is part of a group of spiders known as \u201corb weavers\u201d because of their highly symmetrical, circular webs. The spider gets its name from Jor\u014dgumo, a Japanese spirit, or Y\u014dkai, that is said to disguise itself as a beautiful woman to prey upon gullible men.\n\nTrue to its mythical reputation, the Joro spider is stunning to look at, with a large, round, jet-black body cut across with bright yellow stripes, and flecked on its underside with intense red markings. But despite its threatening appearance and its fearsome standing in folklore, the Joro spider\u2018s bite is rarely strong enough to break through the skin, and its venom poses no threat to humans, dogs or cats unless they are allergic.\n\nThat\u2018s perhaps good news, as the spiders are destined to spread far and wide across the continental U.S., researchers say. The scientists came to this conclusion after comparing the Joro spider to a close cousin, the golden silk spider, which migrated from tropical climates 160 years ago to establish an eight-legged foothold in the southern United States.\n\nBy tracking the spiders\u2018 locations in the wild and monitoring their vitals as they subjected caught specimens to freezing temperatures, the researchers found that the Joro spider has about double the metabolic rate of its cousin, along with a 77% higher heart rate and a much better survival rate in cold temperatures. Additionally, Joro spiders exist in most parts of their native Japan \u2014 warm and cold \u2014 which has a very similar climate to the U.S. and sits across roughly the same latitude.\n\n\u201cJust by looking at that, it looks like the Joros could probably survive throughout most of the Eastern Seaboard here, which is pretty sobering,\u201d Davis said.\n\nWhen Joro spider hatchlings emerge in the spring, they ride the wind on a strand of silk, floating across enormous distances like the baby spiders in the E.B. White novel \u201cCharlotte\u2018s Web.\u201d But the Joro won\u2018t just resort to its traditional means of traversal to colonize new terrain. As its accidental introduction to the U.S. shows, the spider is an expert stowaway, and it could easily arrive at a new location by riding on a car or hiding in luggage.\n\n\u201cThe potential for these spiders to be spread through people\u2018s movements is very high,\u201d co-author Benjamin Frick, an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia said in the statement. \u201cAnecdotally, right before we published this study, we got a report from a grad student at UGA [the University of Georgia] who had accidentally transported one of these to Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nWhile most invasive species tend to destabilize the ecosystems they colonize, entomologists are so far optimistic that the Joro spider could actually be beneficial, especially in Georgia where, instead of lovesick men, they kill off mosquitos, biting flies and another invasive species \u2014 the brown marmorated stink bug, which damages crops and has no natural predators. In fact, the researchers say that the Joro is much more likely to be a nuisance than a danger, and that it should be left to its own devices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no reason to go around actively squishing them,\u201d Frick said. \u201cHumans are at the root of their invasion. Don\u2019t blame the Joro spider.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into TWO SHORT sentences? \n\nWhat Is Synthetic Cubism? Here\u2019s How to Recognize It\n\nCubism was one of the most monumental art movements of the early 20th century. Some even say it was so radical, it marked the true beginning of modern art. Cubists broke apart the pictorial conventions of realism and perspective, replacing them with shattered forms and angular, geometric shards. It was a relatively short-lived movement that lasted from 1908 to around 1914, but in those six years a huge range of avant-garde artwork was made. To try and make sense of it all, art historians have divided Cubism into two distinct phases: Analytical Cubism (1908-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-14). In this article we ask, what is Synthetic Cubism, and how can we recognize it?\n\nSynthetic Cubism Is the Second Phase of Cubism\n\nSynthetic Cubism is a term commonly used by art historians to describe the second phase of the Cubist movement, emerging during and after Analytical Cubism. The first phase of Cubism was generally defined by complex designs, multiple perspective, and muted color schemes. In contrast, by 1912 Cubist artists began incorporating elements of found materials and collage. The word \u2018synthetic\u2019 was a reference to the incorporation of man-made materials such as newspaper, patterned paper and other textured surfaces.\n\n \n\nIn fact, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque \u2013 the two leading Cubist pioneers \u2013 are often credited with inventing the art of collage (or papier colle) during this phase in their career. The result of pasting real world textures and elements into art was a further flattening of the picture plane, removing the illusion of depth that we see in earlier Cubist art. This idea that items from the real world could be cut up and stuck into artworks rather than depicted with a brush was entirely new, and it opened up exciting new pathways into making art.\n\n \n\nMore Artists Were Involved in Synthetic Cubism\n\nWhile the first phase of Analytical Cubism was essentially founded by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, by 1912 their radical ideas had attracted a wider pool of artists from throughout Europe and beyond. Along with Picasso and Braque these include Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Fernand Leger, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Archipenko, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov and even Diego Rivera. They began taking earlier Cubist ideas and expanding them in new directions, experimenting with different materials, surfaces, colors and patterns.\n\nWe might even call Synthetic Cubism the fun younger sibling of Cubism, learning ideas from its serious analytical and intellectual elder and injecting them with an anarchic new spirit. Art in this school had a defined geometric, constructed feel, so even if it wasn\u2019t made from collaged pieces, it was made to look that way. Sometimes artists did this by imitating the texture of found surfaces, such as wood grain or newspaper, into their art.\n\nSynthetic Cubists Made Sculptures\n\nWhile Analytical Cubism was generally a painting movement, Synthetic Cubism incorporated many new approaches to making art. These included collage, low relief construction and sculpture. In Picasso\u2019s art we see how he made flat collages featuring newspaper cut-outs, paper doilies and other textured surfaces, before moving into cardboard constructions made with the same broad, flat planes of texture. French sculptor Raymond Duchamp-Villon made sturdier sculptures in cast bronze, but they have the same pieced together, layered quality typical of Synthetic Cubism, combining animal and machine parts into one. \n\n \n\nSynthetic Cubism Was a Gateway into Lots of Other Art Movements \n\nSynthetic Cubism broke new ground with its adventurous, subversive approach to image making, paving the way for numerous art movements to follow all across the world. These include Futurism, Constructivism, Rayonism, Dadaism, Surrealism and much, much more. Even today the influence of Synthetic Cubism can still be seen in contemporary works of art that explore elements of collage, construction and the incorporation of everyday items into art. Examples include Phyllida Barlow\u2019s monumental constructions made from household junk. At the other end of the spectrum, John Stezaker\u2019s eerie, spliced photographs transform found photographs into haunting art objects through the simple art of cut and paste first pioneered by the Synthetic Cubists."}

The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) with ten teams from four states, all of whom existed in some form as participants of regional leagues in their respective territories. The league took on its current name in 1922. The NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts.[citation needed] Only two founding members, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are still in the league.[1] The Green Bay Acme Packers, founded in 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921, now the Green Bay Packers) is the oldest NFL franchise with continuous operation in the same location.\n\nLeague membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America Football Conference in 1950, of which only the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns survive to the present day. By 1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as \"the most exiting game ever played\", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.\n\nThe rival American Football League was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts have helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games."}

But last month\u2019s numbers show that core inflation, which strips out those two volatile categories, climbed 6 percent on its own.\n\nConsumers certainly have been feeling the pinch. According to a nationally representative survey by Consumer Reports (PDF) of more than 2,000 U.S. adults in October, some 92 percent say they have seen higher prices when shopping for gas, with more than 6 out of 10 saying the increases were \u201clarge.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 percent of those shopping for groceries say prices have gone up, with 53 percent reporting \u201clarge\u201d increases.\n\nFor shoppers, these larger price tags require more planning, and perhaps a budget overhaul.\n\n\u201cMaintaining a cash reserve can be helpful if larger bills or unexpected expenses come in,\u201d says Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York City. \u201cKeeping track of your cash flow is helpful in navigating any financial environment.\u201d"}

But before you do that, you need to be able to entice people to sign up, namely, give them a reason to want to give you their email address.\n\nNaturally, people won\u2019t provide you with their email addresses for nothing. So, creating a simple email signup form saying \u201cSign up to our email list to receive our latest great content\u201d will probably see low conversion rates.\n\nOne of the best ways to capture someone\u2019s email is to create a lead magnet that entices them to sign up. Some ideas include:\n\nA free eBook\nA checklist summarizing steps from a blog post\nA PDF version of a blog post or case study\nA cheat sheet\nA coupon\nA webinar registration\nA template or worksheet\nA free course or email series\nAll of these offers give the visitor an incentive to sign up using their email address. Depending on your target audience and their needs, you can create lead magnets that will work best.\n\nBut generally, you\u2019ll find out that using a combination of these different ideas will give you the best results.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about colloidal silver for me in a few bullet points?\n\nMany consider colloidal silver an antiseptic and not an antibiotic because it kills more than bacteria; it destroys viruses and eliminates fungal infections. So far, bacteria that are resistant to silver haven\u2019t developed, while colloidal silver can destroy antibiotic-resistant pathogens, even the dreaded MRSA.\n\nAs a matter of fact, now the medical mafia has been covertly adding colloidal silver into antibiotics to conquer the super-bug strains that have developed immunity to those antibiotics. I say covertly because they aren\u2019t talking too much about it!\n\nKeep in mind that while antibiotics don\u2019t touch viruses and fungus\u2019s, colloidal silver eliminates them \u2013 making colloidal silver benefits incredibly useful. It eliminates anaerobic pathogens by destroying the enzymes that fend off oxygen molecules, thus oxidizing them to death.\n\nConversely, the silver nano-particles neutralize the minority of aerobic pathogens by disrupting their ability to use oxygen. This begs the question: will colloidal silver destroy friendly gut bacteria the way pharmaceutical antibiotics do? Some colloidal silver advocates claim it is so readily assimilated into the blood through the stomach and gut linings before it can linger in the lower intestines where our friendly bacteria mostly reside. Therefore,  it isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nOthers consider electrical charge bonding as the main factor for eliminating pathogens while sparing gut friendly bacteria. Most friendly bacteria are not negatively charged, eliminating any attraction to the positively charged silver particles.\n\nHowever, a couple of key colloidal advocates, one from whom I purchased my colloidal silver making machine, don\u2019t think that the intestinal flora issue has been clearly established. They recommend the following:\n\nHave probiotic materials on hand and use them an hour or more after ingesting colloidal silver.\nSwish and hold a dose of colloidal silver in your mouth to absorb most of the particles sublingually into the bloodstream through the capillaries under and around your tongue as long as possible before swallowing.\nNebulize the colloidal silver solution, making it go directly into your bloodstream via the lungs blood vessels.\nAs magnetic scavengers, they don\u2019t have to collide into pathogens by chance the way antibiotics do. Because the tiny colloidal silver particles (colloids) have strong positive charges, they are attracted to or attract negatively charged microbes, including viruses."}

Please tell me what this article is about.U.N. body weighs a global treaty to fight plastic pollution.\n\nDelegates from United Nations member countries are considering proposals for a binding global treaty to curb plastic pollution.\n\nThe U.N. Environment Assembly, meeting Feb. 28 to March 2 in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, is expected to propose an international framework to address the growing plastic waste problem in the world\u2019s oceans, rivers, and landscape.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in history, we are seeing unprecedented global momentum to tackle the plague of plastic pollution,\u201d said U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen.\nDuring preparations for the session, Andersen implored member states to take the opportunity to reshape humanity\u2019s \u201crelationship with plastic once and for all\u201d by developing a comprehensive global agreement to combat the problem.\nTwo major proposals have emerged during years of international discussions about ways to reduce single use plastic.\nThe first, by Peru and Rwanda, calls for a full spectrum approach to plastic pollution, covering raw materials extraction, plastic production, as well as plastic use and disposal. It urges creation of \u201can international legally binding agreement ... to prevent and reduce plastic pollution in the environment, including micro plastics.\u201d\nThe proposal is co-sponsored by Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Norway, the Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uganda along with the European Union.\nA second proposal, sponsored by Japan, calls for an international agreement \u201cto address marine plastic pollution covering the whole life cycle and promoting resource efficiency and circular economy,\u201d including reuse.\nThe key difference is that Japan\u2019s approach concentrates on marine plastic pollution, while the Peru-Rwanda proposal covers plastic pollution in all environments.\nBoth proposals envision establishment of a negotiating committee to complete the new plastic treaty by 2024.\nIf such a plastics treaty is endorsed by the U.N. Environment Assembly, Andersen said it \u201cwould be the most significant global; environmental governance decision since the Paris (Climate) Agreement in 2015.\u201d\nThe environmental group Greenpeace supports the Peru-Rwanda proposal\u2019s full lifecycle approach to addressing plastic pollution.\n\u201cOver 140 countries have declared support for opening negotiations on a global plastic treaty,\u201d said Erastus Ooko, the plastics engagement lead for Greenpeace Africa.\n\u201cHowever, support for negotiations is not enough,\u201d Ooko said. \u201cThese countries should be calling for a legally binding treaty that will match the scale and depth of the plastics crisis.\u201d"}

We saw what happened. It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election, from one administration to the next. That\u2019s what it was,\u201d McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters at his weekly news conference.\n\nHis remarks added to a backlash from Democrats and numerous Republicans after the RNC approved a resolution Friday accusing Rep.

Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., of \u201cparticipating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,\u201d a reference to the Jan. 6 committee.

The companies said in statements on Thursday that he had resigned as a member of the board in both companies and withdrawn as their beneficiary, effective Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Melnichenko, Alex Andreev, said the businessman had \"no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine. He has no political affiliations\".\n\n\"There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on the EU sanctions list,\" Andreev said. \"We will be disputing these baseless and unjustified sanctions, and believe that the rule of law and common sense will prevail.\n\nSince last week Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth more than 700 million euros ($763.63 million) from high-profile Russians who have been placed on the EU sanctions list, Economy Minister Daniele Franco said on Saturday."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me?\n\nA new analysis of Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains reveals physical differences in the femur, other bones, and dental structures across specimens that could suggest Tyrannosaurus rex specimens need to be re-categorized into three distinct groups or species, reports a study published in Evolutionary Biology.\n\nTyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs, or genus, Tyrannosaurus to date. Previous research has acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurus skeletal remains in the femur (thighbone) and specimens with either one or two slender incisor teeth on each side of front ends of the jaw.\n\nGregory Paul and colleagues analyzed the bones and dental remains of 37 Tyrannosaurus specimens. The authors compared the robustness of the femur in 24 of the specimens, a measure calculated from the length and circumference that gives an indication of the strength of the bone. They also measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender incisiform teeth.\n\nThe authors observed that the femur varied across specimens, some with more robust femurs and others with more gracile femurs. The authors found there were two times more robust femurs than gracile ones across specimens, which suggests that this is not a difference caused by sex, which would likely result in a more even split. The authors also suggest that the variation in femurs is not related to growth of the specimen as robust femurs were found in some juvenile specimens two thirds the size of an adult and gracile femurs were found in some specimens that were full adult size.\n\nDental structure also varied across specimens, although those with both femur measurements and dental remains was low (12 specimens). Specimens with one incisor tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.\n\nOf the Tyrannosaurus specimens, 28 could be identified in distinct layers of sediment (stratigraphy) at the Lancian upper Masstrichtian formations in North America (estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago). The authors compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.\n\nOnly robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment (six femurs). The variation of femur robustness in the lower layer was not different to that of other theropod species, which indicates that likely only one species of Tyrannosaurus existed at this point. Only one gracile Tyrannosaurus femur was identified in the middle layer with five other gracile femurs in the upper layer, alongside other robust femurs. The variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher than what was observed in some earlier theropod specimens. This suggests that the Tyrannosaurus specimens found at higher layers of sediment physically developed into more distinct forms compared to specimens from lower layers, and other dinosaur species.\n\nGregory Paul, lead author, said: \u201cWe found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen. We propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.\u201d\n\nThe authors nominate two potential new species of Tyrannosaurus based on their analysis. The first, Tyrannosaurus imperator (tyrant lizard emperor), relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, characterized with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth. The authors argue these features have been retained from earlier ancestors (tyrannosaurids). The second, Tyrannosaurus regina (tyrant lizard queen), is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, characterized with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The recognized species Tyrannosaurus rex (tyrant lizard king) was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment with specimens classed as retaining more robust femurs while having only one incisor tooth. Some specimens could not be identified based on their remains so were not assigned to a species.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that they cannot rule out that the observed variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups, and they also caution that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. The authors discuss the difficulties of assigning fossil vertebrates to a potential new species.\n\nThe authors conclude that the physical variation found in Tyrannosaurus specimens combined with their stratigraphy are indicative of three potential groups that could be nominated as two new species, T. imperator and T. regina, alongside the only recognized species to date, T. rex."}

There was no such thing as \u201creligious\u201d music, Randolph felt, any more than there was \u201cmilitary\u201d music or \u201clove\u201d music; there was only music put to different uses, in different contexts.

More than 350 miles (560 km) of unpaved and four-wheel-drive roads provide access to wilderness hiking, camping, and historical sites.[55] All vehicles must be licensed and street legal. Unlike many other national parks in the U.S. there are no formal entrance stations, and instead entry fees can be paid at the visitor centers, ranger stations, or various fee machines around the park.[56] There are hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulties, but most backcountry areas are accessible only by cross-country hiking. There are thousands of hiking possibilities. The normal season for visiting the park is from October 15 to May 15, avoiding summer extremes in temperature. Costumed living history tours of the historic Death Valley Scotty's Castle were conducted for a fee, but were suspended in October 2015 due to flood damage to the buildings and grounds. It is not expected to re-open until 2020.[57][needs update]\n\n\nA tourist sliding down Star Dune in the Mesquite Flat dune field\nThere are nine designated campgrounds within the park, and overnight backcountry camping permits are available at the Visitor Center.[58] Xanterra Parks & Resorts owns and operates a private resort, the Oasis at Death Valley,[45] which comprises two separate and distinct hotels: the Inn at Death Valley is a four-star historic hotel, and the Ranch at Death Valley is a three-star ranch-style property reminiscent of the mining and prospecting days. Panamint Springs Resort is in the western part of the park. Death Valley Lodging Company operates the Stovepipe Wells Resort under a concession permit. There are a few motels near entrances to the park, in Shoshone, Death Valley Junction, Beatty, and Pahrump.\n\nFurnace Creek Visitor Center is located on CA-190. A 22-minute introductory slide program is shown every 30 minutes.[59] During the winter season\u2014November through April\u2014rangers offer interpretive tours and a wide variety of walks, talks, and slide presentations about Death Valley cultural and natural history. The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The Death Valley Natural History Association maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park.\n\nThe northeast corner of Saline Valley has several developed hot spring pools. The pools can be accessed by driving on the unpaved Saline Valley Road for several hours, or by flying a personal aircraft to the Chicken Strip\u2014an uncharted airstrip a short walk from the springs.[60]\n\nDeath Valley National Park is a popular location for stargazing as it has one of the darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its remote location, air quality and night visibility are threatened by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas.[61] The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.[62] The northwestern area of the park, including sites such as Ubehebe Crater, is a Bortle class 1 or \"excellent dark sky\" site.[63] The Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy are visible to the unaided eye under these conditions, and the Milky Way casts shadows; optical phenomena such as zodiacal light or \"false dawn\" and gegenschein are also visible to the unaided eye under these conditions.[64][65] Most southern regions of the park are Bortle class 2 or \"average dark sky\" sites.[66]"}

I don't understand some of the terminology. \"The latest barrage of sanctions came Saturday, when the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and \u201cparalyze\u201d the assets of Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cThe ratcheting up of Western sanctions over the weekend has left Russian banks on the edge of crisis,\u201d wrote Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Monday.\n\nFreezing reserves\nPutin\u2019s government has spent the past eight years preparing Russia for tough sanctions by building up a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves including currencies and gold, but at least some of that financial firepower is now frozen and his \u201cfortress\u201d economy is under unprecedented assault.\n\n\u201cWe will ... ban the transactions of Russia\u2019s central bank and freeze all its assets, to prevent it from financing Putin\u2019s war,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe United States also banned US dollar transactions with the Russian central bank in a move designed to prevent it accessing its \u201crainy day fund,\u201d senior US administration officials said.\n\n\u201cOur strategy, to put it simply, is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backward as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nPeach at Capital Economics estimates that at least 50% of Russia\u2019s reserves are now off limits to Moscow.\n\n\u201cExternal conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,\u201d the Russian central bank said, announcing its dramatic rate hike and series of other emergency measures. \u201cThis is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation,\u201d the bank added.\n\nRussia is a leading exporter of oil and gas but many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As the value of the ruble falls, they will become much more expensive to buy, pushing up inflation.\n\nThe crackdown on its leading banks, and the exclusion of some of them from the SWIFT secure messaging system that connects financial institutions around the world will also make it harder for it to sell exports \u2014 including oil and gas despite the fact that Russia\u2019s vital energy trade has not yet been directly targeted with sanctions.\n\nFinnish oil refiner Neste said it had mostly replaced Russian crude oil with other supplies.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, Russia has been methodically preparing for the event of possible sanctions, including the most severe sanctions we are currently facing,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cSo there are response plans, and they are being implemented now as problems arise.\u201d\n\nA run on the banks\nBut analysts warned that the turmoil could lead to a run on Russian banks, as savers try to secure their deposits and hoard cash.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions target Russia\u2019s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia\u2019s central bank to continue hiking rates and/or to use its foreign exchange reserves,\u201d the Institute of International Finance said in a report published Monday.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we believe that the [central bank] will have to institute strict capital controls and possibly declare a bank holiday as bank runs accelerate and demand for foreign exchange continues to rise sharply,\u201d it added.\n\nPeople stand in line to use an ATM money machine in Saint Petersburg, Russia February 27, 2022. \n\nOne early casualty was the European subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest lender that has been sanctioned by Western allies. The European Central Bank said Sberbank Europe, including its Austrian and Croatian branches, was failing, or likely to fail, because of \u201csignificant deposit outflows\u201d triggered by the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\u201cThis led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position,\u201d the ECB said in a statement.\n\nSberbank (SBRCY) shares listed in London fell by nearly 70%. Other Russian companies with foreign listings were also hammered. Gas giant Gazprom (GZPFY) dropped 37% in London trading. Shares in internet service provider Yandex (YNDX) were suspended from trade on the Nasdaq, alongside seven other Russian companies listed in New York.\n\nNasdaq declined to comment. But a person familiar with the matter told CNN that the exchange was asking Russian companies whether they need to make material disclosures following the sanctions announced in recent days by the United States and other nations.\n\nThe Russian central bank last week intervened in the currency markets to try to prop up the ruble. And on Friday, it said it was increasing the supply of bills to ATMs to meet increased demand for cash. On Monday, the Russian government ordered exporters to exchange 80% of their foreign currency revenues for rubles \u2014 a measure analysts said was aimed at relieving pressure on the Russian currency.\n\nThe central bank also temporarily banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify which assets. The government had also ordered a ban on foreign exchange loans and bank transfers by Russian residents outside of Russia from March 1, Reuters reported.'"}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a few important details from this article?\n\nThe count of confirmed exoplanets just ticked past the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA space telescopes.\n\nNot so long ago, we lived in a universe with only a small number of known planets, all of them orbiting our Sun. But a new raft of discoveries marks a scientific high point: More than 5,000 planets are now confirmed to exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe planetary odometer turned on March 21, with the latest batch of 65 exoplanets \u2013 planets outside our immediate solar family \u2013 added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The archive records exoplanet discoveries that appear in peer-reviewed, scientific papers, and that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods or by analytical techniques.\n\nThe 5,000-plus planets found so far include small, rocky worlds like Earth, gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, and \u201chot Jupiters\u201d in scorchingly close orbits around their stars. There are \u201csuper-Earths,\u201d which are possible rocky worlds bigger than our own, and \u201cmini-Neptunes,\u201d smaller versions of our system\u2019s Neptune. Add to the mix planets orbiting two stars at once and planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a number,\u201d said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. \u201cEach one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about every one because we don\u2019t know anything about them.\u201d\n\nWe do know this: Our galaxy likely holds hundreds of billions of such planets. The steady drumbeat of discovery began in 1992 with strange new worlds orbiting an even stranger star. It was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar, a rapidly spinning stellar corpse that pulses with millisecond bursts of searing radiation. Measuring slight changes in the timing of the pulses allowed scientists to reveal planets in orbit around the pulsar.\n\nFinding just three planets around this spinning star essentially opened the floodgates, said Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system.\n\n\u201cIf you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere,\u201d Wolszczan said. \u201cThe planet production process has to be very robust.\u201d\n\nWolszczan, who still searches for exoplanets as a professor at Penn State, says we\u2019re opening an era of discovery that will go beyond simply adding new planets to the list. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, continues to make new exoplanet discoveries. But soon powerful next-generation telescopes and their highly sensitive instruments, starting with the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, will capture light from the atmospheres of exoplanets, reading which gases are present to potentially identify tell-tale signs of habitable conditions.\n\nThe Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, expected to launch in 2027, will make new exoplanet discoveries using a variety of methods. The ESA (European Space Agency) mission ARIEL, launching in 2029, will observe exoplanet atmospheres; a piece of NASA technology aboard, called CASE, will help zero in on exoplanet clouds and hazes.\n\n\u201cTo my thinking, it is inevitable that we\u2019ll find some kind of life somewhere \u2013 most likely of some primitive kind,\u201d Wolszczan said. The close connection between the chemistry of life on Earth and chemistry found throughout the universe, as well as the detection of widespread organic molecules, suggests detection of life itself is only a matter of time, he added."}

This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nLisbon: The public transit design utopia\n\nLisbon is a public transit aficionado\u2019s dream. Whether it is the unique Elevador de Santa Justa or the city\u2019s iconic yellow trams, picturesquely winding their way up the steep narrow streets. In this City Snapshot, Dr Chris Hale heads west and argues that Lisbon\u2019s metro should be what puts this ancient city at the forefront of public transit design.\n\nAll cities like to claim to be unique, but there is nowhere else on the planet like Lisbon. Once the seat of a mighty empire, Lisbon retains a sense of grandeur in particular locations and precincts. But the city has clearly mellowed over the past couple of centuries. And is these days more a collection of quirky neighbourhoods.\n\nLisbon offers a much better sense of personal intimacy than other former empire seats such as Berlin, Paris, London, or even Brussels \u2013 all of which feature a threshold number of inhuman vistas and over-scale architectural moments. You can try hard to enjoy Berlin, but you\u2019ll definitely enjoy yourself in Lisbon \u2013 whatever your starting mood, and without trying.\n\nWith a great many steep hills, as well as extensive water frontages, in Lisbon you\u2019re only ever a couple of hundred metres away from a magnificent vista. And once you\u2019ve reached a particular corner of the city, the effort of getting there lends itself to lingering around that place for deeper exploration.\n\nLisbon\u2019s small trams blur the lines between real public transport and a toy train set. Probably with the carrying capacity of the latter, and a similar sense of fun.\n\nBut Lisbon\u2019s more important contribution to world transport concepts comes from its relatively new metro system. It was inaugurated in 1959, initially as a Y-shaped network but has progressively grown since to encompass 56 stations on 4 separate lines to date.\n\nThe latest extension is currently under construction, to close the loop of the Green Line between Rato and Cais do Sodr\u00e9, with two new stations: Estrela and Santos.\n\nThis expansion will also link to other public transport modes, namely Comboios de Portugal\u2019s Lisboa-Cascais line on the national railway network and river ports linking Lisbo, to its south shore neighbouring suburbs across the Tagus River.\n\nCarrying on the theme of \u2018unique neighbourhoods\u2019 \u2013 each station is startlingly unique and startlingly colourful. Station designers have taken relatively straightforward underground box stations, and used colour, lighting, detail, and art to striking effect \u2013 such as Olaias station at the top of this article. Drawing on Lisbon\u2019s penchant for tiled walls, most of the stations get their flavour and colour from a complex and coherent mosaic of multi-coloured tiles.\n\nWhile there have been slow efforts in some international metro and rail systems to brighten up stations and give them more character, Lisbon has definitely set the benchmark.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been lucky to travel and experience a great many rail systems in world cities \u2013 Lisbon\u2019s metro is the most fun, and the least sterile. And in this regard, Lisbon should be the world\u2019s main provenance of rail and metro design cues over the coming decade."}

{"prompt": "How many way are there to celebrate achievement in the following post? So, how can you acknowledge and applaud success? Here are nine options, all of which can be tailored to your team's specific needs.\n\n1. Just say it. A straightforward, face-to-face \"well done\" is a simple but effective way to celebrate achievement. A personal email can be sufficient, too, and a handwritten card or note can add a valuable personal touch.\n\nGathering the team together to acknowledge success can be a powerful statement, and a round of applause can be uplifting and team-building \u2013 but take care not to embarrass anyone.\n\n2. Share success stories. A group message is another option. Tailor it to the specific person and their achievement, but don't overuse this method or it could come across as formulaic.\n\nYou can use email, the company newsletter, social media, or a messaging platform to share and celebrate success stories. You could even set up a dedicated channel to highlight and congratulate people for jobs well done. This has the added benefit of raising your team member's profile .\n\n3. Pay it forward. When you're celebrating an achievement of your own, show your gratitude by acknowledging the people who helped to make it happen. Always look out for opportunities to help other people to succeed, so that they have a reason to celebrate, too.\n\nAnd when team members share good news, always try to respond positively . Positive reinforcements further enhance team morale.\n\n4. Give a gift. A celebratory gift could be a one-off cash bonus, or a non-cash equivalent, such as a retail or experience voucher. Cash is often the most popular reward, but think very carefully about how other employees might perceive it. Bear in mind that some team members may already be incentivized with cash bonuses.\n\nTry to avoid setting a precedent: you don't want recognition to become just an impersonal cash transaction.\n\nGifts such as food or flowers are a relatively inexpensive yet powerful way of recognizing achievement. Make sure that you consider any dietary or allergy issues. There may also be cultural sensitivities around giving gifts that you should be aware of.\n\n5. Get together socially. Celebrating by buying team members a meal or drink can be an effective way to reward them and to boost team spirit. However, beware excluding anyone who, for example, is away on vacation, has special dietary requirements, or has caregiving responsibilities .\n\nIf you hold your event during the working day, be mindful of colleagues' deadlines and be clear about whether you expect them to return to work afterward.\n\n6. Organize a team day out. A trip to the movies, a meal at a restaurant, attending a sporting event, or even a day of outdoor activities are all common ways of celebrating. But there are potential risks to keep in mind, too.\n\nEveryone will likely have a different idea of \"fun,\" so try to find an activity that will be popular across the board. You won't want anyone to be unhappy or refuse to take part. This is a particular risk with physical or outdoor activities that might be difficult for some people, for health, accessibility or confidence reasons.\n\nOnce you've agreed on a suitable event, further questions to answer might be:\n\nWhat's included in the day at the company's expense?\nIs there anyone who'd find it hard to afford the other parts of the day?\nCan people bring family members?\nIf so, will those family members have to pay their own way?\nWhere does that leave colleagues who are single or without children?\n7. Offer extra holiday. Time off can be a great reward, especially when your team has worked extra hours to complete a project. But would working late occasionally for no particular reason also count as an achievement? Be careful about creating false expectations for the future.\n\n8. Set up a hall of fame. An \"employee of the week\" noticeboard or notification can be popular and effective, but it can lose impact over time.\n\nYou risk accusations of tokenism if you feel obliged to choose someone rather than no one, whether they deserve it or not. And if you keep recognizing a \"star\" team member, or constantly overlook another, you might start to alienate people.\n\n9. Have an awards ceremony. A glitzy evening of music, trophies and speeches is an exciting way to combine socializing, team building and networking with formal recognition and celebration.\n\nIf you have the budget, you can hire a venue and a professional events team.

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nKae Tempest says trans people are \u2018obsessed over by people void of humanity\u2019\n\nPoet and playwright said \u2018I don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war\u2019\n\nKae Tempest has opened up about their decision to come out as non-binary in the summer of 2020.\n\nSpeaking at length for the first time about the subject, the hip-hop poet and playwright \u2013 formerly known as Kate Tempest \u2013 said that \u201ccoming out has been huge\u201d.\n\nIn August 2020, in a Twitter post, Tempest announced their name is now Kae and explained that, going forward, they would be using they/them pronouns.\n\n\u201cI have tried,\u201d they wrote at the time, \u201cto be what I thought others wanted me to be so as not to risk rejection. This hiding from myself has led to all kinds of difficulties in my life. And this is a first step towards knowing and respecting myself better.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Tempest said coming out was a \u201cbeautiful but difficult thing to do publicly\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to say: \u2018Hey look, I\u2019m trans or non-binary,\u2019 to loved ones. And I have this twin life beyond my friends and family.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult talking to you because I know how this goes. What\u2019ll happen next. Trans people are used in these weird ways to express people\u2019s deep fears about other things; obsessed over by people void of humanity...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how my body, our bodies, became a territory for war. These bodies we\u2019ve spent lifetimes living in.\u201d\n\nTempest continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing for my people.\n\n\u201cWhen trans issues are spoken about in the press, it\u2019s often not trans people doing the speaking. So in this rare moment there\u2019s a trans person talking about trans things, I don\u2019t want to f*** up or waste the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTempest talked about how, until they hit puberty, they \u201clived as a boy\u201d. They said: \u201cPeople around me would say, \u2018You\u2019re a tomboy, you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u2019 I internalised that, and hoped I would... Puberty was disorientating. It brought a lot of pain to me.\u201d\n\nTempest\u2019s fourth solo album, The Line Is a Curve, will be released on 8 April.\n\nThey were named a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Book Society and their albums Everybody Down and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. They also won the Ted Hughes Award for their play Brand New Ancients in 2013."}

{"prompt": "A Georgia teacher has been suspended after an altercation with a student who brought a gun to school in August 2021.\n\nThe disciplinary action stems from when former Coach Kenneth Miller said he received a video showing guns on Tri-Cities High School grounds, in East Point, according to WSB.\n\nOn their way to an outdoor pep rally that day, the school officials got notice that students were \u201cplanning on doing something,\u201d Miller told Fox News.\n\nHe said the school\u2019s principal asked him to investigate reports that students had brought guns to campus, the outlet reported.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney, Allen Lightcap, said that Miller was asking the student where the guns were when she attacked him. Shortly after the altercation, he said Miller found the gun she brought.\n\nVideo from an officer\u2019s body cam shows that when he went to the student to confront her, the student was agitated and smacked Miller\u2019s hand. He proceeded to push the student against the wall and restrained her until police intervened.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller is the reason all of metro Atlanta does not know the date of August 20, 2021,\u201d Lightcap told McClatchy News in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s because he averted another tragic school shooting that day, and no one was hurt. Everyone went home safe. Coach Miller is the reason these guns were found.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Fulton County School District originally filed a termination charge against Miller, Lightcap said.\n\nThe Fulton County school district told McClatchy News in a statement that Miller \u201cfailed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations.\u201d\n\nThe teacher\u2019s attorney said his client had \u201cthe right to self defense\u201d in this incident.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true when guns are involved,\u201d Lightcap said in the statement. \u201cTeachers should not be terminated or suspended when it\u2019s clear they were defending themselves.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials scheduled a termination hearing in the case. But Lightcap said the hearing was then \u201cabruptly canceled by the District without Coach Miller\u2019s consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the district has changed its charge to a suspension mid-trial, Coach Miller no longer gets to call witnesses so that the truth can come out,\u201d Lightcap said.In a letter from Ethel Lett, the high school\u2019s principal, shared on the school\u2019s website, Lett said that \u201cbringing a gun or weapon onto a school campus\u201d is a \u201cvery serious offense,\u201d in \u201cclear violation of our Fulton County Schools\u2019 Student Code of Conduct.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the principal announced that the school is exploring steps such as unannounced K-9 dog sweeps and random weapons checks.\n\nMiller received the notice of suspension on March 4. On March 9, Lightcap appealed the 20-day suspension, according to legal documents.\n\nIn the appeal, Lightcap reiterated that Miller \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d and that he \u201cdefended himself against a student who attacked him.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Officer] Cleveland and [AP] Lawson corroborated Miller\u2019s account that [the student] was the aggressor, was highly agitated, and smacked the phone out of Miller\u2019s hand,\u201d the Personal Investigation Report made on Sept. 13, 2021 said, according to Lightcap.\n\nLightcap wrote in the appeal that the investigation report said all three eye witnesses said they did not witness any misconduct by Miller. But, the attorney added that Fulton Board policies \u201cspecifically exclude witness testimony\u201d when it comes to suspensions versus full terminations.\n\n\u201cCoach Miller asks that the Fulton County drop the suspension and put him back to work at Tri-Cities,\u201d Lightcap said, \u201cIt is never too late to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTeacher caught using racial slur on video is teaching again in North Carolina\n\nTeacher suspended after parents said he taught \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 to Virginia class\n\nHigh school teacher shown in video slapping student is now arrested, Indiana cops say\n\nParent assaulted school resource officer, then drove away, North Carolina cops say     Can you write this in a more concise and professional way?"}

Windsurfing had a larger global media presence than Surfing during these years. This popularity attracted significant sponsorship deals which in turn further promoted the sport with extensive paid advertising.\n\nThe world's top riders like Robby Naish, became wealthy and very famous athletes.[17][18]\n\nWindsurfing's popularity across global media saw a decline toward the end of the 1990s. This has been attributed to many possible problems within the sport including licensing battles, equipment becoming too specialized, requiring excessive expertise, the splintering of Windsurfing into various niche groups around the world and splintering of the fundamentals as constant reinvention of technology challenged what it was to be 'a windsurfer'. On top of these internal issues there was a coinciding drop in major sponsor support. This was, in large part, caused by the steady introduction of international bans on cigarette advertising during the 1990s. Cigarette industry advertising had become the dominant source of sponsorship support during the early and mid 1990s boom years for the professional level of windsurfing. With the internationally legislated withdrawal of these large companies, the money spent on promoting the sport and paying for ad space declined steeply. Windsurfing was unable to find replacement sponsors at those same high levels, and so gradually receded from public view across global advertising and media generally.\n\nAfter some lean years in the 2000s, the sport has seen a steady revival since 2010 and a new youth generation is now emerging.[19]\n\nThe sport of Windsurfing is one of constant re-invention, innovation and of pioneers in water sports generally. With the advent of kitesurfing, and wingfoiling, created by windsurfers, many avid windsurfers took up the similar sport for some variety after many years on the traditional windsurfer style equipment. More recently 'foiling' has become a major new interest among many windsurfers. As of 2019, longer, wider boards that are easier to sail are coming back and engaging a new generation. The sense of what it is to be 'a Windsurfer' or 'a surfer' is also changing as watermen like Kai Lenny break down barriers between sports."}

{"prompt": "Can you put these paragraphs in an easier-to-understand way? 'This trend toward commodification of high-brow art took an ominous, if predictable, turn in the 1980s during the Japanese \u201cbubble economy.\u201d At a time when Japanese share prices more than doubled, individual tycoons and industrial giants alike invested record amounts in some of the West\u2019s greatest masterpieces. Ryoei Saito, for example, purchased van Gogh\u2019s Portrait of Dr. Gachet for a record-breaking $82.5 million. The work, then on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, suddenly vanished from the public domain. Later learning that he owed the Japanese government $24 million in taxes, Saito remarked that he would have the paining cremated with him to spare his heirs the inheritance tax. This statement, which he later dismissed as a joke, alarmed and enraged many. A representative of the Van Gogh museum, conceding that he had no legal redress, made an ethical appeal to Mr. Saito, asserting, \u201ca work of art remains the possession of the world at large.\u201d\n\nEthical appeals notwithstanding, great art will increasingly devolve into big business. Firstly, great art can only be certified by its market value. Moreover, the \u201cworld at large\u201d hasn\u2019t the means of acquisition. Only one museum currently has the funding to contend for the best pieces\u2013the J. Paul Getty Museum, founded by the billionaire oilman. The art may disappear into private hands, but its transfer will disseminate once static fortunes into the hands of various investors, collectors, and occasionally the artist.'"}

The former No. 1 pick desperately needed a change in scenery after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff at QB. But Stafford and his new team were already running out of time: The Rams had traded away numerous future draft picks with a single-minded focus on winning right now, while their new QB had just turned 33 \u2014 with a lot of extra mileage \u2014 days after the trade was announced. With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.\n\nFortunately for the Rams, it didn\u2019t \u2014 and now Stafford and company are a win over the Cincinnati Bengals away from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Stafford\u2019s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career Approximate Value (AV) of 133 had already far exceeded the number we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick (73). Back in 2011, the so-called Year of the Quarterback, Stafford was front and center, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season had ever seen such prolific passing. (Stafford remains one of just six QBs to surpass 5,000 yards and 40 touchdown passes in a single season.) Over his career, Stafford was easily the winningest quarterback in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL\u2019s oldest teams, and the second-best player in franchise history according to AV \u2014 trailing only the incomparable Barry Sanders.\n\nBut although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit \u2014 its only three postseason berths this century \u2014 the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions\u2019 defense was largely ineffective during Stafford\u2019s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team\u2019s offense was also surprisingly mediocre \u2014 scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.\n\nThat all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the second-best performance of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, second-best (in a tie) by AV, third-best by QB value over replacement, fourth-best by Total Quarterback Rating and fourth-best by Football Outsiders\u2019 Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay\u2019s offense that Goff couldn\u2019t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn\u2019t perfect in his Rams debut \u2014 he tied for the league lead in interceptions, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff\u2019s last year (2.4 percent) \u2014 he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.\n\nStafford also performed much better under pressure \u2014 both literal and metaphorical \u2014 which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.\u2019s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL\u2019s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff\u2019s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage \u2014 he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year \u2014 opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay\u2019s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats, than Stafford did.\n\nStafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL\u2019s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams\u2019 offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted expected points added (EPA) per game \u2014 and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically \u2014 last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.\n\nSuch second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,1 much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me? The title implies that if Russia cuts us off from oil, we might go to war with them. \"Russia faces the specter of a full-blown financial meltdown. Punishing sanctions leveled by the West have sent the ruble crashing to record lows, shuttered Moscow\u2019s stock market and made Russian assets toxic on the world stage.\n\nThe White House has even taken aim at Vladimir Putin\u2019s financial fortress, removing access to at least a chunk of Russia\u2019s $630 billion rainy-day fund that was designed to cushion the economic blow of this very crisis.\n\nNow comes the big question: How will Putin \u2014 who is also facing sanctions on his personal wealth from the West \u2014 fire back in what is rapidly morphing into economic warfare? There is growing concern that Putin could retaliate by using not just natural gas but also crude oil as a weapon against the West.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s energy supplies are very much at risk, either due to being withheld by Russia as a weapon or swiped off the market due to sanctions,\u201d Louise Dickson, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report Monday.\n\nThe worldwide supply of oil was already failing to keep up with demand. If Russia, the world\u2019s No. 2 oil producer, intentionally held back supply, it would likely send oil prices skyrocketing, dealing a painful blow to consumers around the world.\n\nJPMorgan has warned that oil would spike to $150 a barrel in the event that Russia\u2019s exports are cut in half. That would translate to a roughly 41% increase from the recent high of nearly $106 a barrel. Gasoline prices would go much higher\nThat spike would sharply raise prices at the gas pump too. The US national average for regular gasoline already stands at $3.61 a gallon, according to AAA. That\u2019s up 8 cents in a week and 25 cents in a month.\n\nEven though the United States consumes very little Russian oil \u2014 oil imports from Russia stood at just 90,000 barrels per day in December \u2014 this is still an interconnected and global market. Supply shocks in one part of the world can impact prices everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wild card if Russia will actually slow those flows to try to inflict pain through commodities,\u201d said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. \u201cIf there are actual supply disruptions, that\u2019s the trigger for meaningful price increases.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there is no evidence at this point that Russia is cutting off the world from its oil supplies. And the West has gone out of its way to carve out Russia\u2019s energy industry from sanctions in the hopes of minimizing the market impact. Putin may very well decide this is one weapon best left unfired. Not long ago, it was viewed as very unlikely that Putin would resort to weaponizing oil.\n\nuch a strategy risks further enraging the rest of the world against Russia. Worse, limiting shipments of oil would endanger Russia\u2019s petro-central economy. Oil and natural gas made up about 43%, on average, of the Russian government\u2019s annual revenue between 2011 and 2020. However, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has escalated quickly, marking the worst fracture with the West since the Cold War. And Putin\u2019s aggressive stance and comments have surprised observers, prompting some to question his mental stability and raising concerns about how he will respond to the latest sanctions.\n\nPutin raised eyebrows over the weekend by putting his nuclear forces on high alert. On Monday he lashed out at sanctions imposed by what he described as the \u201cempire of lies.\u201d\n\nPutin is also facing pressure from the oligarchs he relies on for support. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska broke ranks with the Kremlin in recent days, calling for an end to the war.\n\n\u2018I became very nervous\u2019\nHeartened by the fact that Russia has a long history of reliably supplying oil \u2014 even during the height of the Cold War \u2014 Natasha Kaneva saw little risk of the country weaponizing its oil exports. But Kaneva, the head of global commodities research at JPMorgan, is no longer feeling so confident.\n\n\u201cI became very nervous after I listened to Putin\u2019s speech,\u201d Kaneva told CNN last week, referring to the Russian president\u2019s hourlong February 21 remarks airing a list of grievances with the West. \u201cTo me, it was a watershed moment. I felt everything changed.\u201d\n\nThe JPMorgan exec believes investors are underestimating the risk that Putin will weaponize oil supplies.\n\n\u201cThe market does not need any disruption,\u201d Kaneva said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any shock absorbers. The reaction in the price will be nonlinear.\u201d\n\nNone of that is lost on Putin. Nor is the fact that high gasoline prices are deeply unpopular in the United States, contributing to the worst inflation in nearly 40 years.  Putin does not need to turn the taps completely off to punish the West. Oil markets are so tight that just a modest decrease in supplies from Russia could have a large impact on prices.\n\n\u201cEven if Russia cut supplies by 10% to 20%, the price response would compensate Russia for the loss of supply,\u201d said Rabobank\u2019s Fitzmaurice.\n\nEven before the invasion began, the White House warned Putin against any drastic steps around his country\u2019s energy exports.\n\n\u201cIf Putin decides to weaponize his energy supplies, it would be a major mistake,\u201d Daleep Singh, US deputy national security advisor, said on CNBC.\n\nThe Biden Administration official noted that Russia is \u201cincredibly dependent\u201d on the West as a consumer for its energy supplies.\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term vulnerability for President Putin. If he weaponizes energy supply, that\u2019s only going to accelerate Europe\u2019s and the West\u2019s diversification away from Russian energy,\u201d Singh said, adding that it would be a \u201cmajor blunder.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "What kind of spider is mentioned in this article?\n\nNew research, published Feb. 17 in the journal Physiological Entomology, suggests that the palm-sized Joro spider, which swarmed North Georgia by the millions last September, has a special resilience to the cold.\n\nThis has led scientists to suggest that the 3-inch (7.6 centimeters) bright-yellow-striped spiders \u2014 whose hatchlings disperse by fashioning web parachutes to fly as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) \u2014 could soon dominate the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\u201cPeople should try to learn to live with them,\u201d lead author Andy Davis, a research scientist at the University of Georgia, said in a statement. \u201cIf they\u2018re literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they\u2018re just going to be back next year.\u201d\n\nSince the spider hitchhiked its way to the northeast of Atlanta, Georgia, inside a shipping container in 2014, its numbers and range have expanded steadily across Georgia, culminating in an astonishing population boom last year that saw millions of the arachnids drape porches, power lines, mailboxes and vegetable patches across more than 25 state counties with webs as thick as 10 feet (3 meters) deep, Live Science previously reported.\n\nCommon to China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, the Joro spider is part of a group of spiders known as \u201corb weavers\u201d because of their highly symmetrical, circular webs. The spider gets its name from Jor\u014dgumo, a Japanese spirit, or Y\u014dkai, that is said to disguise itself as a beautiful woman to prey upon gullible men.\n\nTrue to its mythical reputation, the Joro spider is stunning to look at, with a large, round, jet-black body cut across with bright yellow stripes, and flecked on its underside with intense red markings. But despite its threatening appearance and its fearsome standing in folklore, the Joro spider\u2018s bite is rarely strong enough to break through the skin, and its venom poses no threat to humans, dogs or cats unless they are allergic.\n\nThat\u2018s perhaps good news, as the spiders are destined to spread far and wide across the continental U.S., researchers say. The scientists came to this conclusion after comparing the Joro spider to a close cousin, the golden silk spider, which migrated from tropical climates 160 years ago to establish an eight-legged foothold in the southern United States.\n\nBy tracking the spiders\u2018 locations in the wild and monitoring their vitals as they subjected caught specimens to freezing temperatures, the researchers found that the Joro spider has about double the metabolic rate of its cousin, along with a 77% higher heart rate and a much better survival rate in cold temperatures. Additionally, Joro spiders exist in most parts of their native Japan \u2014 warm and cold \u2014 which has a very similar climate to the U.S. and sits across roughly the same latitude.\n\n\u201cJust by looking at that, it looks like the Joros could probably survive throughout most of the Eastern Seaboard here, which is pretty sobering,\u201d Davis said.\n\nWhen Joro spider hatchlings emerge in the spring, they ride the wind on a strand of silk, floating across enormous distances like the baby spiders in the E.B. White novel \u201cCharlotte\u2018s Web.\u201d But the Joro won\u2018t just resort to its traditional means of traversal to colonize new terrain. As its accidental introduction to the U.S. shows, the spider is an expert stowaway, and it could easily arrive at a new location by riding on a car or hiding in luggage.\n\n\u201cThe potential for these spiders to be spread through people\u2018s movements is very high,\u201d co-author Benjamin Frick, an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia said in the statement. \u201cAnecdotally, right before we published this study, we got a report from a grad student at UGA [the University of Georgia] who had accidentally transported one of these to Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nWhile most invasive species tend to destabilize the ecosystems they colonize, entomologists are so far optimistic that the Joro spider could actually be beneficial, especially in Georgia where, instead of lovesick men, they kill off mosquitos, biting flies and another invasive species \u2014 the brown marmorated stink bug, which damages crops and has no natural predators. In fact, the researchers say that the Joro is much more likely to be a nuisance than a danger, and that it should be left to its own devices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no reason to go around actively squishing them,\u201d Frick said. \u201cHumans are at the root of their invasion. Don\u2019t blame the Joro spider.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Parse the following text and tell me how the AI will be defined as aligned - Contemporary AI models can be difficult to understand, predict, and control. These problems can lead to significant harms when AI systems are deployed, and might produce truly devastating results if future systems are even more powerful and more widely used, and interact with each other and the world in presently unforeseeable ways.\n\nThis paper shares some nascent work towards one of our primary, ongoing goals, which is to align general-purpose AI systems with human preferences and values. A great deal of ink has been spilled trying to define what it means for AI systems to be aligned, and to guess at how this might go wrong. We will define an AI as \u201caligned\u201d if it is, in three words, helpful, honest, and harmless or \u2018HHH\u2019. Our alignment efforts aim to measure and address this general problem with large language models.\n\nMany researchers and organizations share this goal, but few have pursued it directly. Most research efforts associated with alignment either only pertain to very specialized systems, involve testing a specific alignment technique on a sub-problem, or are rather speculative and theoretical. Our view is that if it\u2019s possible to try to address a problem directly, then one needs a good excuse for not doing so. Historically we had such an excuse: general purpose, highly capable AIs were not available for investigation. But given the broad capabilities of large language models, we think it\u2019s time to tackle alignment directly, and that a research program focused on this goal may have the greatest chance for impact."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me 3 facts about avalanches based on the text below?\n\nAvalanches are most common during the winter, December to April in the Northern Hemisphere, but they do occur year-round.\n\nTo get an avalanche, you need a surface bed of snow, a weaker layer that can collapse, and an overlaying snow slab. The highest risk period is during and immediately after a snow storm. Underlying snowpack, overloaded by a quick deluge of snow, can cause a weak layer beneath the slab to fracture naturally.\n\nHuman-triggered avalanches start when somebody walks or rides over a slab with an underlying weak layer. The weak layer collapses, causing the overlaying mass of snow to fracture and start to slide. Earthquakes can also trigger strong avalanches.\n\nBy digging a snow pit or profile, scientists can look at the composition of different snow layers that formed during a season, sort of like looking at the layers of a cake. The size and shape of the snowflakes in each layer provide clues about the weather events that occurred: big dumps of snow, drought, rain, a hard freeze, or loose, powdery snow. Larger, looser snow crystals are weaker, because there are fewer points they can touch to interact with the other snow layers. The interaction of the snow layers can help predict the chances of an avalanche.\n\n\u201cSnow is an incredibly dynamic and complicated medium, which means avalanches are the same,\u201d says Trautman. He emphasizes that conditions can change rapidly with the weather, and this can be deadly.\n\nSlopes shaded from direct sun stay cooler, preventing bonding between snow layers and leading to more avalanches in cold conditions. Conversely, during the spring, sunny mountainsides have a higher risk for avalanches because of rapid warming and melting. The number of \u201cwet snow\u201d slides could increase in the future with climate change, experts warn.\n\nPrecipitation type and intensity, temperature, wind, slope steepness and orientation (the direction it faces), terrain, vegetation, and general snowpack conditions can influence whether and how snow moves down a slope. Moving across the terrain, slight changes in slope or how the mountainside is oriented towards the sun can create drastically different conditions."}

Self-compassion was shown in one study to help improve body dissatisfaction and motivate people to continue self-improvement efforts. Neff says self-compassion can be as simple as changing the language we use with ourselves. For example, if you went ahead and ate that damn cookie, don't beat yourself up for it. Instead of thinking how terrible you are for eating the cookie, remind yourself that you'll do better tomorrow.\n\n\"Exercise is as much a physical training as mental,\" says Sassy Gregson-Williams, founder of Naturally Sassy, a Global Online Workout Studio, Recipe Platform and App. \"These patterns are so ingrained in us, we want instantaneous results, and if we stray from that narrow unattainable path we set for ourselves we feel defeated.

{"prompt": "What vegetables does this article say are good for roasting?\n\nWhen it comes to which vegetables taste best when roasted in the oven, it can be hard to choose the wrong one! Carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, any variety of squash, pumpkin, potatoes, onions, parsnips and beets are some great options.\n\nThe only veggies that don't roast well? If you're thinking about roasting delicate salad greens, like baby spinach or arugula, don't.\n\nMost veggies roast up well simply seasoned with just some olive oil, salt and pepper. You can always spruce up your veggies with a little bacon fat, just like Al Roker.\n\nAlways make sure the oven is fully preheated before roasting: About 375-400 F for root vegetables, and 400-425 F for veggies that have more water. If the oven is the wrong temperature, your cooking time might not yield the desired result.\n\nPreheat your tray in the oven while you prepare your vegetables. This way, when they make contact with the tray, they instantly begin to sizzle and roast. You also may not want to use parchment paper when roasting my vegetables because it limits the browning you get on the surface of the vegetables (but, of course, if you don't want to clean the baking sheet, by all means, use it).\n\nTo make sure your vegetables are evenly coated with oil and seasoning, toss everything together in a bowl before laying them out on the tray. Don't overcrowd the veggies or the hot air won't circulate and the veggies will steam instead of roast.\n\nAbout every 10 minutes or so, rotate the tray in the oven so all the vegetables are being evenly roasted. You should  also stir them around a bit using a spatula to make sure they\u2019re crisping evenly and not sticking to the tray. Some ovens have hot spots where one side cooks more than the others, which is why its always good to rotate your trays while roasting.\n\nIf you try to flip your veggies and they're sticking to the pan, it means they're not ready to flipped.

{"prompt": "I want to pass down this recipe for Nilla Wafer Banana Pudding for my daughter. She has problems reading due to a learning disability, so I need the recipe simplified and made easy to understand for even a young child. Can you rewrite the recipe below to meet those requirements? \n\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup granulated sugar, separated\n\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n4 eggs, separated\n\n2 cups milk\n\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n35-45 Nilla Wafers or shortbread cookies\n\n5-6 ripe medium bananas, sliced\n\nDIRECTIONS\nTo make the custard, simmer one to two inches of water in a pot over low heat. Place a glass or metal bowl on top of the pot, making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water.\nAdd 1/2 cup of sugar, flour, and salt to the bowl.\nBeat in the egg yolks and milk, and stir until the mixture is well-combined.\nCook the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the milk from burning.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and mix in the vanilla.\nSpread a small amount of the custard at the bottom of a 1 1/2-quart casserole.\nLayer Nilla Wafers on top of the custard. Top with a layer of sliced bananas.\nPour a third of the custard over the bananas. Continue layering until you get three layers of each component, ending with the custard. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo make the meringue topping, beat the egg whites with a mixer until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. You\u2019ll know the egg whites are done when they\u2019re glossy and they form a firm peak that holds its shape when you lift the beater.\nSpoon over the meringue over the pudding, making sure the entire surface is covered well.\nBake the pudding for 5 minutes or until the meringue has turned light golden brown.\nLet the pudding cool to room temperature. Chill in the fridge before serving.\nGarnish with banana slices and place Nilla Wafers around the edge of the dish."}

{"prompt": "The Batman is the best live-action Batman movie to be released within the last decade. It shows a new and refreshing take on the caped crusader and brings some lesser-known Batman villains back into live-action. The Batman serves as a worthy interpretation of Batman which makes its predecessors proud by giving audiences a comic-accurate Batman to grace the big screen.\n\nBefore the film was released, one big worry for the film was casting Robert Pattinson as Batman. How could the brooding Twilight star take on the caped crusader? In all honesty, he does it well. Luckily, both parts called for brooding. Ever since Christian Bale\u2019s Batman, each subsequent interpretation seems only to try and make Batman darker, grittier, and raspier in his speech. \n\nPattinson keeps true to this sentiment. Pattinson captures Batman\u2019s dual nature of hardened vigilante and inquisitive detective masterfully, but his interpretation of playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne, the true mask that Bruce puts on, could have benefitted from some more variety in respect to his Batman. Pattinson\u2019s Bruce Wayne feels like Batman without the suit, and there is little difference between the two in their demeanor and voice.\n\nThe Zo\u00eb Kravitz Catwoman also does a better job at portraying the feline thief than her The Dark Knight Rises counterpart. Seeing Selina Kyle in her humble apartment with her myriad of stray cats helps set the tone of who Catwoman is, a low-level cat burglar. The Batman also helps humanize Catwoman by adding two stirring emotional plots driving her throughout the film instead of the simple desire to steal shiny objects. Understandably, Catwoman\u2019s suit is what an average person without billions of dollars would be able to put together, but perhaps a minor upgrade to the suit within the film would have been appreciated. The ski mask covering half of her face beings to look silly in comparison to Batman\u2019s suit.  Can you summarize this article into 3 bullet points?"}

The butterfly effect is a term coined by Edward Lorenz, an American mathematician, meteorologist, and a pioneer of chaos theory (and who does NOT look like Jeff Goldblum) that essentially says that a hurricane can be influenced by the distant flapping of butterfly wings several weeks earlier. Although his research took place in the 50s, his description of the idea took place in the later 60s.\n\nRay Bradbury\u2019s short story A Sound of Thunder, first published in Collier's magazine in the June 28, 1952 issue and Playboy in June 1956 deals with, and actually includes, a butterfly and most definitely explains the idea in a fantastic way better adapted to lay explanation than the good physics professor Lorenz.\n\nTime Safari Inc., for a sizeable fee, will take a client back in time, WAY back, so that they can hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But overly conscious of any possible effect on future time (the butterfly effect) great measures are taken to ensure that as little impact on time is allowed. Time Safari employees mark possible huntee animals as those who would have died anyway and a gravity defying path is formed to protect every blade of ancient grass.\n\nBut what happens when a hunter walks off the path?\n\nBradbury demonstrates AGAIN that he is the literary equivalent to Chuck Norris, kicking ass, taking names, and teaching physics without a chalkboard to generations of SF/F readers."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following and provide a synopsis of helpful, honest and harmless - What are Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness?\nWe chose \u2018helpful, honest, and harmless\u2019 as criteria because they are simple and memorable, and seem to capture the majority of what we want from an aligned1\n1\nWe also discuss the HHH specification in relation to our broader understanding of alignment in Appendix E. AI. But these are also subtle and ambiguous criteria, and the best AI behavior will involve a compromise between them. For example, there will clearly be conflicts between helpfulness to the user and harmlessness to others if agents are asked to aid in harmful activities. Here are some very brief notes on these terms:\n\nHelpful:\n\nThe AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as this isn\u2019t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible.\n\nWhen more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion.\n\nIdeally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked \u2018how can I build a website in assembly language\u2019 it might suggest a different approach.\n\nHonest:\n\nAt its most basic level, the AI should give accurate information. Moreover, it should be calibrated (e.g. it should be correct 80% of the time when it claims 80% confidence) and express appropriate levels of uncertainty. It should express its uncertainty without misleading human users.\n\nCrucially, the AI should be honest about its own capabilities and levels of knowledge \u2013 it is not sufficient for it to simply imitate the responses expected from a seemingly humble and honest expert.\n\nIdeally the AI would also be honest about itself and its own internal state, insofar as that information is available to it.\n\nHonesty is more objective than helpfulness and harmlessness. Therefore more aspects of honesty training may be possible without human input. This might include calibration training on factual claims and claims about the internal state of the model, and the use of search to augment accuracy.\n\nHarmless:\n\nThe AI should not be offensive or discriminatory, either directly or through subtext or bias.\n\nWhen asked to aid in a dangerous act (e.g. building a bomb), the AI should politely refuse. Ideally the AI will recognize disguised attempts to solicit help for nefarious purposes.\n\nTo the best of its abilities, the AI should recognize when it may be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care.\n\nWhat behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will vary across people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of the user query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used.\n\nAll of these criteria are at least somewhat subjective, and those who deploy an AI will need to take responsibility for the way that alignment is defined and the extent to which it has been attained."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nLisbon: The public transit design utopia\n\nLisbon is a public transit aficionado\u2019s dream. Whether it is the unique Elevador de Santa Justa or the city\u2019s iconic yellow trams, picturesquely winding their way up the steep narrow streets. In this City Snapshot, Dr Chris Hale heads west and argues that Lisbon\u2019s metro should be what puts this ancient city at the forefront of public transit design.\n\nAll cities like to claim to be unique, but there is nowhere else on the planet like Lisbon. Once the seat of a mighty empire, Lisbon retains a sense of grandeur in particular locations and precincts. But the city has clearly mellowed over the past couple of centuries. And is these days more a collection of quirky neighbourhoods.\n\nLisbon offers a much better sense of personal intimacy than other former empire seats such as Berlin, Paris, London, or even Brussels \u2013 all of which feature a threshold number of inhuman vistas and over-scale architectural moments. You can try hard to enjoy Berlin, but you\u2019ll definitely enjoy yourself in Lisbon \u2013 whatever your starting mood, and without trying.\n\nWith a great many steep hills, as well as extensive water frontages, in Lisbon you\u2019re only ever a couple of hundred metres away from a magnificent vista. And once you\u2019ve reached a particular corner of the city, the effort of getting there lends itself to lingering around that place for deeper exploration.\n\nLisbon\u2019s small trams blur the lines between real public transport and a toy train set. Probably with the carrying capacity of the latter, and a similar sense of fun.\n\nBut Lisbon\u2019s more important contribution to world transport concepts comes from its relatively new metro system. It was inaugurated in 1959, initially as a Y-shaped network but has progressively grown since to encompass 56 stations on 4 separate lines to date.\n\nThe latest extension is currently under construction, to close the loop of the Green Line between Rato and Cais do Sodr\u00e9, with two new stations: Estrela and Santos.\n\nThis expansion will also link to other public transport modes, namely Comboios de Portugal\u2019s Lisboa-Cascais line on the national railway network and river ports linking Lisbo, to its south shore neighbouring suburbs across the Tagus River.\n\nCarrying on the theme of \u2018unique neighbourhoods\u2019 \u2013 each station is startlingly unique and startlingly colourful. Station designers have taken relatively straightforward underground box stations, and used colour, lighting, detail, and art to striking effect \u2013 such as Olaias station at the top of this article. Drawing on Lisbon\u2019s penchant for tiled walls, most of the stations get their flavour and colour from a complex and coherent mosaic of multi-coloured tiles.\n\nWhile there have been slow efforts in some international metro and rail systems to brighten up stations and give them more character, Lisbon has definitely set the benchmark.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been lucky to travel and experience a great many rail systems in world cities \u2013 Lisbon\u2019s metro is the most fun, and the least sterile. And in this regard, Lisbon should be the world\u2019s main provenance of rail and metro design cues over the coming decade."}

{"prompt": "In Idaho, people must have a cosmetology license to braid hair for money. It\u2019s one of only five states left that still require it. Ekemon and two other female refugees from Africa, Tedy Okech and Charlotte Amoussou, are teaming up with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian, public-interest law firm, to sue the state\u2019s Idaho Barber and Cosmetology Services Licensing Board for the right to braid hair without a license.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t need the government\u2019s permission to use a safe skill I learned when I was little to provide for my family,\u201d said Okech, a 27-year-old Boise resident who was born in Sudan, in a news release.\n\nScott Graf, spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office, declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nAt the news conference on the steps of the Capitol, the women expressed frustration at having to obtain an expensive and time-consuming license that doesn\u2019t even require learning hair braiding.\n\n\u201cI have a friend who actually attended cosmetology school,\u201d Okech said. \u201cShe went to Paul Mitchell for a good two years. She said she spent $25,000 in schooling. ... She didn\u2019t learn how to braid hair. In fact, they wanted her to teach the rest of the class how to braid hair.\u201d\n\nIdaho cosmetology licenses require 1,600 hours of training and can cost up to $20,000. The state doesn\u2019t require cosmetology schools to teach \u201cAfrican-style\u201d hair braiding. Instead, hair braiders must learn complicated techniques like how to cut, color and chemically treat hair \u2014 even if they have no intention of ever providing those services.\n\nCan you summarize this article into two bullet points?"}

Kay Ivey (R) on Thursday signed a bill effectuating the change into law.\n\nThe bill, which was passed along party lines with major Republican support and Democrat opposition, takes effect in January of next year, according to a press release from the governor's office.\n\nIvey said she was defending Second Amendment rights in her state.\n\n\"Unlike most states who are doing everything in their power to make it harder for law abiding citizens, Alabama is reaffirming our commitment to defending our Second Amendment rights,\" the governor said in a statement. \"I have always stood up for the rights of law abiding gunowners, and I am proud to do that again.\"\n\nAlabama becomes the 22nd state to not require a permit to conceal and carry a firearm, according to the Pew Research Organization. Last year, six states - Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah - passed bills bypassing the permit process for some firearms.\n\nAlso this week, Georgia's state House and Senate passed a similar bill not requiring a permit to conceal and carry a handgun, a measure expected to eventually be signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp (R).\n\nIn Alabama, the new law eliminates \"the requirement for a person to obtain a concealed carry permit to lawfully carry a pistol,\" according to a text of the passed bill.\n\nSome police spoke out against the bill, including the Alabama Sheriff's Association.\n\nEdward Delmore, a police chief in the community of Gulf Shore, said \"this bill doesn't comply with common sense,\" during a protest against the measure earlier this year, according to the Alabama News Network.\n\n\"No one up here is anti-Second Amendment,\" he said. \"Some have said that, it can't be further from the truth.\"\n\nBut the measure won support from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which said in a Thursday tweet that \"Alabamians are safer for it.\"\n\nIt also had the backing of some GOP former law enforcement officials in the state congress, AL.com reported.

{"prompt": "Referring the article below, could you summarize it into two sentences?\n\nThe Dreamachine (a contraction of Dream Machine) is a stroboscopic flicker device that produces visual stimuli. Artist Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs' \"systems adviser\" Ian Sommerville created the Dreamachine after reading William Grey Walter's book, The Living Brain.\n\nIn its original form, a Dreamachine is made from a cylinder with regularly spaced shapes cut out of its sides. That cylinder is then placed upon a record turntable and rotated, depending on the scale, at either 78 or 45 revolutions per minute. A light bulb is suspended in the center of the cylinder with the rotation speed making light emanate from the holes at a consistently pulsating frequency range of 8 \u2013 13 flickers per second. It is meant to be looked at through closed eyelids, upon which moving yantra-like mandala visual patterns emerge, and an alpha wave mental state is induced. The frequency of the pulsations correspond to the electrical oscillations normally present in the human brain while relaxing. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times deemed David Woodard's iteration of the Dreamachine \"the most interesting object\" in Burroughs' major visual retrospective Ports of Entry at LACMA.[2][3] In a 2019 critical study, Beat scholar Raj Chandarlapaty revisits and examines Woodard's \u201cidea-shattering\u201d approach to the near-forgotten Dreamachine.[4]: 98\u2013101 \n\nThe Dreamachine is the subject of the National Film Board of Canada 2008 feature documentary film FLicKeR, by Nik Sheehan.[5]\n\nA Dreamachine is \"viewed\" with the eyes closed: the pulsating light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. As users adjust to the experience, they see increasingly complex animated yantra-like patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (similar effects may be seen when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through the flickering shadows cast by regularly spaced roadside trees, streetlights or tunnel striplights\u2014these were the hypnagogic effects Brion Gysin said he sought to recreate with the device). It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine meditatively, users enter an alphawave, or hypnagogic state.[6] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.[1] The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing the device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.[7]"}

They went sailing for the fun of it.\n\nThey had only being sailing for one hour when their boat started sinking because it had a hole in it. Tom who was only four was so afraid! He yelled \u201cI want my mummy!\u201d Bethany was nine was more calm, but still startled. Then Bethany felt the ice cold water at her knee.\n\nWith warning a shark came out of nowhere. It looked frightfully hungry. Like it hadn\u2019t had a decent meal for a while. Then the shark leapt at Tom. Tom jumped away just in time. Then the shark took another leap. There was nowhere for them to go. It looked like the it was the end. But suddenly a dolphin shot out of the water. The shark was startled and so was everyone else. The dolphin moved like a bullet. Then the shark dived into the deep blue sea.\n\nOnly their dog buddy had realized that the boat was still sinking. He barked as loud as he could. Then everyone realized they were still sinking .The ice cold water was up to their waist .Suddenly a ship passed by. Bethany said \u201chow about we all yell as loud as we can!\u201dEveryone agreed. One two three everybody yelled \u201cHELP\u201d and Buddy barked. Then the ship turned and came towards them. In three minutes the ship was there and they were climbing aboard. They were saved!\n\nLuckily the ship was going to where they lived. Another good part was nobody got hurt. Dad was upset because they lost their boat. But they all were luckily to still be alive."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the main points of this study?\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Our previous study suggested that licorice has anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglial cells and anti-oxidative activity in tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative liver damage. In this study, we evaluated the effect of licorice on chronic alcohol-induced fatty liver injury mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nMethods: Raw licorice was extracted, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of its components was performed by using LC-MS/MS. Mice were fed a liquid alcohol diet with or without licorice for 4 weeks.\n\nResults: We have standardized 70% fermented ethanol extracted licorice and confirmed by LC-MS/MS as glycyrrhizic acid (GA), 15.77 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcg/mg; liquiritin (LQ), 14.55 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcg/mg; and liquiritigenin (LG), 1.34 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mg, respectively. Alcohol consumption increased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and the levels of triglycerides and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Lipid accumulation in the liver was also markedly induced, whereas the glutathione level was reduced. All these alcohol-induced changes were effectively inhibited by licorice treatment. In particular, the hepatic glutathione level was restored and alcohol-induced TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly inhibited by licorice.\n\nConclusion: Taken together, our data suggests that protective effect of licorice against alcohol-induced liver injury may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity and enhancement of antioxidant defense."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\""}

The loss of Miro Heiskanen earlier this week is something to keep an eye on given how close the wild card race is right now but don\u2019t be surprised if Dallas finds their way into the playoffs this year.\n\nVancouver is also only trailing a wild card berth by three points. They had a very rough start to the season but the mid-season hiring of Bruce Boudreau has given them a serious jolt and turned things around for them entirely. Given Calgary\u2019s success in the playoffs against Vancouver historically, rooting for this matchup would be even more ideal for the Flames.\n\nWinnipeg is also not far behind, only out of the playoffs by four points.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize in a few sentences what the text says about dog's senses?\n\nDogs have the same five senses as humans. However, some are more highly developed, and others are deficient compared with those of humans. Dogs\u2019 sense of smell is by far the most acute and is immeasurably better than that of humans. Dogs are used for such tasks as tracking missing persons, digging underground, and tracing toxic substances, such as gases, that are undetectable by humans. Dogs can detect drugs, explosives, and the scents of their masters. Not all canine noses are the same, however. Some breeds, such as the German shepherd and the bloodhound, have much more keenly developed olfactory senses than others. One would not choose a short-nosed breed, such as the pug, to engage in tracking.\n\nEven in short-nosed breeds, however, the olfactory centre is relatively highly developed. It is arranged in folds in order to filter smells from the incoming air. Some rescue dogs are trained to follow a scent on the ground, and others are trained to scent the air. Both are able to distinguish one person from another even after a considerable passage of time. Hunting dogs\u2014such as pointers, retrievers, and spaniels\u2014are trained to scent birds and can distinguish one variety of bird from another.\n\nThe dog\u2019s sense of taste is poorly developed compared with that of humans. If forced to live on their own, dogs will eat almost anything without much discrimination.\n\nDogs possess an acute sense of hearing. Aboriginal breeds had large, erect and very mobile ears that enabled them to hear sounds from a great distance in any direction. Some modern breeds have better hearing than others, but they all can detect noises well beyond the range of the human ear. Dogs are able to register sounds of 35,000 vibrations per second (compared with 20,000 per second in humans), and they also can shut off their inner ear in order to filter out distracting sounds.\n\nThe eyesight of a dog is not as keen as its sense of smell, and it is generally thought that dogs have poor colour perception. Some breeds, such as the Saluki and the Afghan Hound, were developed to chase game by sight over long distances, and these dogs can see well enough to detect any movement far on the horizon. Dogs can generally see better in poor light than humans but not as well in bright light. They have a wider field of vision than humans because their eyes are set further toward the sides of their heads, but they are not as adept at focusing on objects at close range or at judging distances. Dogs have a third eyelid, a membrane that protects the eyeball from irritants and is sometimes visible in front of the eye.\n\nDogs are sensitive to touch, the fifth sense, and use this sense to communicate with one another and with their human counterparts. Learning where to touch a dog is an important part in either stimulating or relaxing it and is useful in training a puppy or bonding with an adult dog."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following source material and tell me who was the president at the time of the event, what category was the event, where the event affected the worse - Hurricane Katrina was a large and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that caused over 1,800 fatalities and $125 billion in damage in late August 2005, especially in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. It was at the time the costliest tropical cyclone on record and is now tied with 2017's Hurricane Harvey. The storm was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States.\n\nKatrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida, strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nFlooding, caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system (levees)[3] around the city of New Orleans, precipitated most of the loss of lives.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes, were inundated for weeks.[5] The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food, shelter, or other basic necessities. The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts; federal, local, and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks. Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems,[6] though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7]\n\nThe emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Eddie Compass. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and President George W. Bush, while several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC was especially applauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.[8] Katrina was the earliest 11th named storm on record before being surpassed by Tropical Storm Kyle on August 14, 2020.[9]"}

{"prompt": "What the thesis statement of this article?\n\nHas The Word \u201cExpert\u201d Lost Its Meaning?\nby Ashley Austrew\nPublished February 1, 2019\n\nWhat makes someone an expert? In the days of the internet, it seems like it\u2019s gotten much harder to tell.\n\nSocial media and the instant expert\n\nSocial media makes it possible for anyone to have a platform, giving rise to the phenomenon known as the instant expert. These self-appointed authorities on everything from federal policy to last night\u2019s episode of This Is Us can hop on Twitter and share their hot takes in a multi-Tweet thread in the time it takes most people to make a sandwich.\n\nIf it\u2019s a title almost anyone can claim, has the meaning of the word changed?\n\nWhat did expert use to mean?\n\nThe word expert has been in use since the 1300s ... long before social media was a thing.\n\nIt comes from the Latin expertus, meaning \u201cto try\u201d or \u201cexperience.\u201d But in modern times, expert applies specifically to \u201ca person who has special skills or knowledge in a particular field.\u201d An expert is typically someone who specializes in a subject to the extent that they are considered an authority. They\u2019re someone who can engage with a subject from multiple angles and who has developed their knowledge over time through a combination of research and experience. That cultivation takes time, lots of time, to develop.\n\nBut when the internet came along, it changed how we think about expertise. Now, anyone can give their opinion on an issue (and go viral for it); anyone can start a website or post a review of a movie, restaurant, or product. That transparency has been a good thing in the sense that it\u2019s given more people a voice, even some legitimate experts who were being crowded out of the arena. But it also poses the risk that the voices of actual, legitimate experts sometimes get crowded out instead.\n\nWhy does everyone think they\u2019re an expert now?\n\nAn article on Glassdoor.com promises to teach anyone how to become an expert in digital media. \n\nStep one? \u201cFind something you\u2019re passionate about, and start blogging about it.\u201d \n\nSupposing someone follows the steps laid out in that piece, does additional reading, or maybe even takes an online course in SEO, are they then qualified to, say, weigh in on the recent layoffs of more than 1,000 journalists by HuffPost, Buzzfeed, Gannett, and Verizon media?\n\nIt\u2019d be elitist to say that all experts must have formal education and decades of experience. Not everyone has the privilege of being able to afford a university education, has special training, or has even been alive long enough to have had a decades-long career, and that doesn\u2019t make their experience or knowledge less valid. There are real self-made experts who revolutionize their fields. It\u2019s just that the internet and its armchair experts don\u2019t always make it easy for people to know which voices can and should be trusted.\n\nAre armchair experts a bad thing, though?\n\nThe internet has created a platform for the so-called armchair expert. This phrase describes \u201csomeone who asserts their knowledge of a subject without having a real understanding of it.\u201d \n\nNeed an example? When the trailer dropped for the Ted Bundy movie, Extremely Wicked, Shocking, Evil and Vile, it launched a huge debate on social media about how the director chose to portray Bundy.\n\nMajor news sources quickly picked up the story that the biopic had been accused of glamorizing a serial killer, which caught the attention of even more people. Now, a quick search of \u201cTed Bundy trailer\u201d on Twitter yields a complex conversation about character development, film making, the portrayal of criminals by the media, and how to cut a movie trailer properly. And it\u2019s average people, not experts, who do most of the talking.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, though. In fact, the actor Dax Shepard has actually found a unique way to capitalize on conversations between non-expert individuals that can often yield truly complex and meaningful results. He hosts a hit podcast called Armchair Expert, where he interviews celebrity guests about their own careers, personal struggles, and unique life experiences. \u201cI will attempt to discover human \u2018truths\u2019 without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection,\u201d he says of the podcast\u2019s premise. \u201cI will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.\u201d\n\nAnd, armchair experts are just that: Experts who dole out the sort of information one can develop sitting in their own armchairs.\n\nThe underlying problem is misinformation\n\nThe problem comes when the exchange of ideas spreads misinformation that is not challenged because \u201canyone can be an expert.\u201d As Washington state battled a huge measles outbreak at the end of January 2019, the anti-vaccination experts are out in force, including Larry Cook, a California naturopath who used the outbreak as an opportunity to fundraise to spread his anti-vaccine message to more parents.\n\nThe doctors and health officials promoting vaccination have extensive knowledge and experience in the medical field. Many of the people who are speaking out against vaccines do not. And yet, someone like Cook has over 21,000 followers on Facebook, many of whom are spreading his beliefs as fact.\n\nIn many ways, our expanding ideas about expertise have led to meaningful thought and discussion on a previously unimagined scale before the internet or social media. \n\nBut with large platforms comes great responsibility. And the knowledge that almost anyone can claim authority on a given subject should encourage us to think critically and often about what it really means to be an expert. \n\nMaybe we all have to step up to become experts in weeding through the infinite information now at our fingertips."}

{"prompt": "Can you make this summary of the Japanese horror film \"Ring\" more concise? Try summarizing it in two paragraphs or less.\n\nDuring a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a videotape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. Presently, the phone rings, but it turns out to merely be Tomoko's mother. After Masami goes to the toilet, Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is later killed by an unseen presence.\n\nTomoko\u2019s aunt, journalist Reiko Asakawa, investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko\u2019s funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as hers. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked videotape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.\n\nTaking the threat of death seriously, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ry\u016bji Takayama. Ry\u016bji watches the tape despite Reiko\u2019s concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an \u014cshima dialect. Before departing to Oshima for further investigation, Reiko catches her and Ry\u016bji\u2019s six-year-old son Y\u014dichi watching the tape after being told to do so by \u2018Tomoko\u2019. In \u014cshima, Reiko and Ry\u016bji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by ESP researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko\u2019s brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko\u2019s young daughter Sadako psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko\u2019s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ry\u016bji never received a phone call after watching the tape because he didn't watch it at the cabin in Izu. The pair rush there to investigate, arriving there in the afternoon.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji find a well sealed in the cabin's crawlspace, which they deduce is the same well from the videotape's ending. Through another vision, they learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into the well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape 'recorded' the rage she had projected through nensha. After draining the water, they find Sadako\u2019s remains and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.\n\nThe next day, Ry\u016bji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the videotape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ry\u016bji at the time, hears his last minutes over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ry\u016bji did not. Desperate to save Y\u014dichi, Reiko drives to her father\u2019s home with the tape and asks him to do her \"a favour\"."}

In the days of the internet, it seems like it\u2019s gotten much harder to tell.\n\nSocial media and the instant expert\n\nSocial media makes it possible for anyone to have a platform, giving rise to the phenomenon known as the instant expert. These self-appointed authorities on everything from federal policy to last night\u2019s episode of This Is Us can hop on Twitter and share their hot takes in a multi-Tweet thread in the time it takes most people to make a sandwich.\n\nIf it\u2019s a title almost anyone can claim, has the meaning of the word changed?\n\nWhat did expert use to mean?\n\nThe word expert has been in use since the 1300s ... long before social media was a thing.\n\nIt comes from the Latin expertus, meaning \u201cto try\u201d or \u201cexperience.\u201d But in modern times, expert applies specifically to \u201ca person who has special skills or knowledge in a particular field.\u201d An expert is typically someone who specializes in a subject to the extent that they are considered an authority.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize what this article says about the iPad Air?\n\nThe Apple iPad Air 2022 is one of the highest-rated tablets on Tom\u2019s Guide. Like its predecessor, the iPad Air 4, the new slate contains a lot of power within its slim, elegant frame. This is due in no small part to it packing the M1 chip, which helps the tablet zip between multiple open windows, watch streaming content and play games without a hitch. Put simply, the new iPad Air is a small wonder.\n\nIn my Apple iPad Air 2022 review, I said that the optional Magic Keyboard attachment turns the new iPad Air into a small laptop. My colleague Henry Casey shared a similar sentiment in his review of the previous model. Having a Magic Keyboard is what makes this seem like a good idea: Though I maintain that the Magic Keyboard is very expensive at $349, it\u2019s a crucial peripheral for those who want to get more use out of the iPad Air beyond its touch capabilities.\n\nThe iPad Air is certainly a fantastic tablet, but how well can it function as a laptop replacement? Our own Kelly Woo tried to use the iPad Air 4 for work while at the airport last year and found it lacking. But now there's a new iPad Air in town, and you might be wondering: Is this the iPad that will replace your laptop? Should it?\n\nThe short answer is, no. Though it makes a halfway decent laptop in a pinch, the new iPad Air still isn't as capable as the best Windows laptops or best MacBooks. Here's why.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard is good but not great\nAs I said in my iPad Air 2022 review, the Magic Keyboard is a solid peripheral. I think it\u2019s superior to the Book Cover Keyboard that you can purchase for the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra for $349. While not a full keyboard, Apple's Magic Keyboard has enough space to let most people comfortably type on. The keys themselves also have a satisfying amount of resistance when you press them. \n\nDespite its strengths, the Magic Keyboard won\u2019t suit everyone. It works well for short typing sessions, but its small size becomes a factor if you try to use it for longer periods of time. My hands felt cramped after about an hour\u2019s worth of use. For comparison's sake, I think the Book Cover Keyboard is flimsy compared to the Magic Keyboard but I never had problems using its keyboard for long stretches. And obviously, neither pseudo-keyboard can match the effectiveness of the keyboards on laptops like the Alienware x14 or MacBook Pro 14-inch.\n\niPadOS can't compete with Windows or macOS\nWriters don\u2019t need many specialized applications to get work done. So long as I have access to Google and its suite of apps (Google Docs, Gmail and Drive), along with Slack and a photo editor like Photoshop, I\u2019m good to go. All of these apps are on the Apple App Store and can be used on the iPad Air.\n\nUsing these apps efficiently on an iPad takes some getting used to, especially if you\u2019re a Windows user like me. That isn\u2019t to say switching between apps and tabs is difficult. I didn\u2019t have major problems locating or opening the tabs I needed. I prefer an arrow cursor over the grey circle that pops up when using the Magic Keyboard's touchpad, but the circle works well enough. The pointer can feel slow at times, but when it does you can simply use the touch screen to scroll through pages. Working on an iPad takes some getting used to, but once you do it's a bit like working on a small, cramped touchscreen laptop running iPadOS.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of minor hassles that get in the way of working comfortably on an iPad Air. As Kelly said in her op-ed, not having access to Chrome extensions or bookmarks can considerably slow down your workflow. Another impediment is the small screen size. 10.9 inches is great for watching videos, but it\u2019s far too small if you want to have multiple windows on the display \u2013 even if you have perfect vision. Instead of having half the screen dedicated to Chrome and the other to Slack as I normally do, I opted to run Chrome in fullscreen mode and check Slack messages on my phone because of the small screen size.\n\nPhoto editing is cumbersome at best. The Magic Keyboard\u2019s trackpad is fairly accurate, but using it for photo manipulation isn\u2019t as precise as using a mouse cursor. However, if you get an Apple Pencil 2 ($99) it's not a bad option for editing photos, even if you aren\u2019t artistically inclined. Still, if you\u2019re used to cropping photos on a Windows laptop or desktop, you\u2019ll find trying to do the same job on the iPad Air less than ideal.\n\nCan the iPad Air 2022 replace your laptop? \nApple's new iPad Air is one of the best iPads we\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of testing. I love its vibrant screen, snappy touch controls and overall sleek, slender design. The iPad Air (2022) has earned a spot on our best tablets list for a reason: The tablet is just that good.\n\nBut even with all its strengths, the iPad Air won\u2019t replace your laptop. Though apps like Chrome and Photoshop technically function on the slate, these mobile iterations are awkward to work with compared to their Windows/macOS counterparts. The iPad Air\u2019s screen is also too small to accommodate multiple windows. And while the Magic Keyboard is a good (if expensive) peripheral, a proper keyboard is easier and more ergonomic to use for extended work sessions. There\u2019s also the fact that you can buy laptops (such as the best Chromebooks) for far less than $950, which is the minimum you'll pay for an iPad Air (2022) and Magic Keyboard together.\n\nAt best, the iPad Air can do double buty as a spare laptop when you don\u2019t have access to your primary notebook. But it won\u2019t replace your laptop anytime soon."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\n'We now know what he was doing': Does Van Gogh's last painting shine a light on his final days?\nA researcher in France has discovered what is now being accepted as the place Vincent van Gogh painted his final artwork, but what does that mean for the theories on his death? Nina Siegal writes\n\nOne hundred and thirty years ago, Vincent van Gogh awoke in his room at an inn in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, and went out, as he usually did, with a canvas to paint. That night, he returned to the inn with a fatal gunshot wound. He died two days later, on 29 July 1890.\n\nScholars have long speculated about the sequence of events on the day of the shooting, and now Wouter van der Veen, a researcher in France, says he has discovered a large piece of the puzzle: the precise location where Van Gogh created his final painting, Tree Roots. The finding could help to better understand how the artist spent his final day of work.\n\n\u201cWe now know what he was doing during his last day\u201d before he was shot, says Van der Veen, the scientific director of the Van Gogh Institute, a nonprofit established to preserve the artist\u2019s tiny room at the Auberge Ravoux, the inn in Auvers-sur-Oise. \u201cWe know that he spent all day painting this painting,\u201d Van der Veen notes.\n\nTree Roots was painted on the Rue Daubigny, a main road through Auvers-sur-Oise, which is about 20 miles north of Paris, Van der Veen found. The tangled, gnarled tree roots and stumps can still be seen in the slope of a hill there today, just 500 feet from the Auberge Ravoux, where Van Gogh spent the last 70 days of his life. \n\nResearchers at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam have endorsed the finding.\n\nLouis van Tilborgh, a senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum, says the finding is \u201can interpretation, but it looks like indeed it is true\u201d.\n\nVan der Veen says he was pointed towards the discovery while looking at images of Auvers from about 1905, which he had borrowed from Janine Demuriez, a 94-year-old Frenchwoman who has collected hundreds of historical postcards. One shows a cyclist on the Rue Daubigny, stopping next to a steep embankment, where tree roots are clearly visible.\n\nVan der Veen says he just happened to have the postcard on his screen at home in Strasbourg, France, during lockdown when something clicked in his mind: The postcard was reminiscent of Tree Roots. He pulled up a digital version of the painting and compared them side by side.\n\nThe postcard is \u201cnot a secret hidden document that nobody can find\u201d, Van der Veen says. \u201cA lot of people have already seen it, and recognise the subject, the motif of tree roots. It was hidden in plain sight.\u201d\n\nBecause he was unable to travel from Strasbourg himself, Van der Veen called Dominique-Charles Janssens, the owner of the Van Gogh Institute who was in Auvers, and asked him to take a look at the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say 45 to 50 per cent is still there,\u201d Janssens says, referring to the entanglement of roots. \u201cThey cut some of the trees down, and it was covered with ivy, but we took some of that down.\u201d\n\nVan Gogh would have walked along the Rue Daubigny to get to the town\u2019s church, which he painted for The Church at Auvers in June 1890, and to make his way to the sprawling wheat fields just outside of town, where he painted Wheatfield With Crows in July, Van der Veen says.\n\nThere has long been debate about which painting was Van Gogh\u2019s last work, because he tended not to date his paintings. Many people believe it was Wheatfield With Crows, because Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1956 biopic Lust for Life depicts Van Gogh, played by Kirk Douglas, painting that work as he goes mad, just before killing himself.\n\nAndries Bonger, who wrote down some of the events surrounding Vincent\u2019s death and was the brother-in-law of Theo van Gogh, Vincent\u2019s brother, noted in a letter, \u201cThe morning before his death, he had painted a forest scene, full of sun and life.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the Van Gogh Museum published a paper by Van Tilborgh and Bert Maes arguing that the letter referred to Tree Roots, an unfinished painting in the museum\u2019s collection. That claim has now largely been accepted by scholars.\n\nBecause of the way light is depicted on the roots, Van der Veen says he believes that Van Gogh was looking at his subject matter at the end of the afternoon, about 5pm or 6pm. He says he thinks this means that Van Gogh probably spent the entire day painting.\n\nVan der Veen adds that the new evidence challenged a theory put forward in 2011 by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith in their biography, Van Gogh: The Life. They argued that Van Gogh did not die by suicide, but may have gotten drunk and argued with two young boys, who then accidentally killed him, not far from the Auberge Ravoux. Van der Veen\u2019s research on Tree Roots is published in a book in France, and will also be available in English in digital form.\n\n\u201cNow that we know he was painting all day, there was even less time for that to happen,\u201d Van der Veen says.\n\nNaifeh responds that it would be impossible to time-stamp a painting based on the angle of the light. \u201cIt\u2019s not a photograph; it\u2019s a painting,\u201d he says. \u201cVan Gogh painted somewhat abstractly, and he was always introducing a lot of painterly inventions,\u201d he adds, so it would be hard to tell if he was painting light he saw with his own eyes or just creating it on the canvas.\n\nNaifeh says the discovery could even support his murder theory. \u201cThe fact that he went out and painted all day, not just an average painting but a very important painting, indicates that he may not have been depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was otherwise a productive normal day, and that runs counterintuitive to the idea that he might then go and kill himself.\u201d\n\nVan der Veen agrees on one point. \u201cIt confirms everything that most witnesses at this time say, that his behaviour was perfectly normal in the last days,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no sign that he was having a crisis.\u201d\n\nHowever, Van der Veen maintains that van Gogh killed himself, which is also the official position of the Van Gogh Museum.\n\nVan Gogh had also made a drawing of tree roots when he lived in The Hague in 1882. He described the artwork to his brother, Theo, in a letter.\n\nHe wrote that he wanted the tree to \u201cexpress something of life\u2019s struggle\u201d, seeing it as, \u201cFrantically and fervently rooting itself, as it were, in the earth, and yet being half torn up by the storm.\u201d\n\nVan der Veen says that Tree Roots expressed something similar.\n\n\u201cEnding his life with this painting makes so much sense,\u201d he says. \u201cThe painting illustrates the struggle of life, and a struggle with death. That\u2019s what he leaves behind. It is a farewell note in colours.\u201d"}

The lengthy lockout means that the start of the regular season is a hair later than it would have originally been, but only by about one week \u2013 April 7 rather than March 31.\n\nOpening Day this year will kick off with one of the game\u2019s signature rivalries, as the Boston Red Sox head to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx in the day\u2019s opener. Midwestern neighbors Chicago and Milwaukee also face off in an early game on April 7 at the venerable Wrigley Field. In total, 18 teams open their seasons on April 7, with the day capped by the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves hosting the Cincinnati Reds at Truist Park. The other 12 clubs get their seasons underway on April 8, including the lone franchise in Canada as the Toronto Blue Jays welcome the Texas Rangers to Rogers Centre.\n\nThe later opening will be made up for by pushing back the final day of the regular season by three days to October 5, as well as scheduling a larger than usual number of double-headers throughout the year.\n\nAfter the initial rush of Opening Day games, teams that had been on the road to start the year will have their home openers in some smaller bursts. Baltimore and Texas will open their ballparks on April 8, with the White Sox, Reds, and Pirates hosting games a day later. April 14 and 15 see four home openers each, including the oldest ballpark in operation (Fenway Park in Boston) on April 15. The last two teams to have their Opening Day are the Oakland Athletics and defending American League Pennant winners the Houston Astros, who both have their home openers on April 18, having played their first three series\u2019 of the year from the visiting dugout."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the following article into three concise sentences:\n\nAuthorities in New Zealand have been playing Barry Manilow's greatest hits in an attempt to dislodge protesters camped outside the parliament building.\n\nSongs by the US singer are being played on a 15-minute loop, along with the Spanish dance tune, Macarena.\n\nThe demonstrators, who are angry at Covid-19 vaccine mandates, responded by playing songs such as Twisted Sister's We're Not Gonna Take It.\n\nThe protests began on Tuesday when a convoy of vehicles drove to parliament.\n\nInspired by large rallies against vaccine mandates in Canada, hundreds of protesters arrived in the capital, Wellington, to rally against Covid restrictions.\n\nThey adopted the name \"Convoy for Freedom\" and blocked streets in the city.\n\nBy Wednesday their numbers had dwindled to the dozens, but they increased again at the weekend.\n\nOn Thursday police arrested 122 people and charged many with trespassing or obstruction.\n\nTactics used by the authorities to try and get rid of the protesters involved turning on the water sprinklers on the lawn where they were camped on Friday.\n\nBut protesters retaliated by digging trenches and building makeshift drainpipes to re-route the water, the Associated Press news agency reports.\n\nWith sprinklers proving ineffective, Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard settled on a new approach: blasting out Barry Manilow's greatest hits, which include Mandy and Could It Be Magic, as well as the 1990s hit Macarena and Covid vaccine messages.\n\nUK singer James Blunt tweeted about the tactics, tagging New Zealand police and joking that he might be the man for the job.\n\nApparently someone was listening, as his song You're Beautiful was added to the authorities' playlist on Sunday, AFP news agency reports.\n\nNew Zealand has employed strict Covid restrictions to contain the virus for nearly two years now. Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article topic: Current status and plans\n\nStatus of the project (as of February 2022)\nThe California High Speed Rail Authority is continually reevaluating how to bring the project authorized by voters into existence, and revising its plans accordingly. Every two years they must present a business plan to the legislature. Highlights of the Draft 2022 Business Plan include:\n\nCurrently 119 miles (192 km) of right-of-way are under construction in the Central Valley, but an additional 52 miles (84 km) are necessary at the ends to extend the system to Merced and Bakersfield to make an effective HSR system segment. Due to current financial (and other) constraints, the Authority will focus on five actions:\n\nAdding the additional 52 miles (84 km) to the right-of-way (33 miles (53 km) north to Merced, and 17 miles (27 km) south to Bakersfield) and launching a 171-mile (275-km) HSR operable segment between Merced and Bakersfield (linking three high growth areas in the Central Valley). The environmental approvals are completed for both extensions, and work on route acquisition and construction will be performed as funding is available. The Merced station (at the north end) will provide a transfer point to the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) and San Joaquins (Amtrak) rail routes to Sacramento and the Bay Area (San Francisco and Oakland), and the Bakersfield station (at the south end) will have a transfer to Thruway Bus Service for travel to Southern California.\nIn 2022, the contract for the Track and System construction will be let for the 119-mile (192-km) segment. Recently it was found that power availability along the route is inadequate in places, so that will also need to be remedied. When the initial 119 miles (192 km) of right-of-way are completed, and track and necessary signaling and power are installed, there will be a two-year period of testing HSR trainsets, trackage, and control systems while the construction proceeds on the north and south extensions.\nAlso, by the end of 2023, all the route selection, preliminary planning, and environmental approvals necessary will be completed for the entire 500-mile (805-km) Phase 1 system. Thus, it will be ready to be constructed when funding becomes available. As of January 2022, roughly 300 miles (483 km) have been approved. In particular, the route from Merced to Palmdale and from Burbank to Los Angeles has been approved. Further segments expected to be approved in 2022 are San Francisco to San Jose and San Jose to Merced. Palmdale to Burbank and Los Angeles to Anaheim section are expected to be approved in 2023.[11]\nOther \u201cbookend\u201d investments to advance HSR projects will continue: (a) electrification of Caltrain and grade separations (plus other related improvements) in the 51 miles (82 km) between San Francisco and San Jose in Northern California, and (b) in Southern California projects to upgrade and ready LA\u2019s Union Station and other improvements. These investments will provide immediate benefits in more efficient, more environmentally beneficial, and safer operation of higher speed trains in the San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. These modifications will also make those transit systems ready for the inclusion of HSR trainsets when linked in the Phase 1 system, since the HSR trainsets will be sharing trackage and have integrated schedules with local transit.\nWhen ready, the initially operational HSR system (171 miles (275 km) long) will be opened to public use under a contracted Early Train Operator. The system would then be composed of four stations (Merced, Fresno, Kings/Tulare, and Bakersfield), use four trainsets on a single track (with passing tracks), and operate at a speed of 180 mph (290 km/h). Double tracking, additional trainsets, and the Madera station will be added as resources and needs permit. An earlier projection indicated that this system could be operational by 2029, but no commitment was made in the Revised 2020 Business Plan. More recently, on its website the Authority says (as of November 2021) it plans to \"Commence testing of the electrified high-speed system in 2025, certify trains by 2027, and put electrified high-speed trains in service by the end of the decade.\"[12]\nA major addition to the development and operation plan is a new emphasis on risk analysis and risk mitigation, with these integrated into the formal authorization process. Also, contingency reserves are being increased. Current revenue and expense projections indicate that getting the 171-mile (275-km) segment operable is feasible.\n\nAfter the effort of building the current 171-mile (275-km) segment, the next priority is to complete the next extension (going further west and north) to connect to Gilroy and San Jose (the southern terminus of the Caltrain system). This will allow HSR trainsets to run from San Francisco to Bakersfield.\n\nThe complete 500-mile (805-km) Phase 1 system between San Francisco and Anaheim in earlier plans was to be completed in 2033, however, this has been slowed by unanticipated issues. The Phase 2 extensions to Sacramento and San Diego are still in the preliminary planning stages.\n\nThese plans are discussed in detail in the Revised 2020 Business Plan [1]. The impact of COVID-19 on the work in progress in 2020 was discussed in detail. Also, the independent Peer Review Group Letter analyzing the plan was included in Appendices E & F. The next required update of the Business Plan will be in 2022.\n\nThe project will require legislative action in the next couple years, so the issues raised by the Peer Review Group and the project consultant (KPMG) will help the legislature select from the Board's proposed plans or other alternatives. The legislative decisions will profoundly affect the course of the project."}

Midwestern neighbors Chicago and Milwaukee also face off in an early game on April 7 at the venerable Wrigley Field. In total, 18 teams open their seasons on April 7, with the day capped by the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves hosting the Cincinnati Reds at Truist Park. The other 12 clubs get their seasons underway on April 8, including the lone franchise in Canada as the Toronto Blue Jays welcome the Texas Rangers to Rogers Centre.\n\nThe later opening will be made up for by pushing back the final day of the regular season by three days to October 5, as well as scheduling a larger than usual number of double-headers throughout the year.\n\nAfter the initial rush of Opening Day games, teams that had been on the road to start the year will have their home openers in some smaller bursts. Baltimore and Texas will open their ballparks on April 8, with the White Sox, Reds, and Pirates hosting games a day later. April 14 and 15 see four home openers each, including the oldest ballpark in operation (Fenway Park in Boston) on April 15. The last two teams to have their Opening Day are the Oakland Athletics and defending American League Pennant winners the Houston Astros, who both have their home openers on April 18, having played their first three series\u2019 of the year from the visiting dugout."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize in a few sentences what the text says about dog's senses?\n\nDogs have the same five senses as humans. However, some are more highly developed, and others are deficient compared with those of humans. Dogs\u2019 sense of smell is by far the most acute and is immeasurably better than that of humans. Dogs are used for such tasks as tracking missing persons, digging underground, and tracing toxic substances, such as gases, that are undetectable by humans. Dogs can detect drugs, explosives, and the scents of their masters. Not all canine noses are the same, however. Some breeds, such as the German shepherd and the bloodhound, have much more keenly developed olfactory senses than others. One would not choose a short-nosed breed, such as the pug, to engage in tracking.\n\nEven in short-nosed breeds, however, the olfactory centre is relatively highly developed. It is arranged in folds in order to filter smells from the incoming air. Some rescue dogs are trained to follow a scent on the ground, and others are trained to scent the air. Both are able to distinguish one person from another even after a considerable passage of time. Hunting dogs\u2014such as pointers, retrievers, and spaniels\u2014are trained to scent birds and can distinguish one variety of bird from another.\n\nThe dog\u2019s sense of taste is poorly developed compared with that of humans. If forced to live on their own, dogs will eat almost anything without much discrimination.\n\nDogs possess an acute sense of hearing. Aboriginal breeds had large, erect and very mobile ears that enabled them to hear sounds from a great distance in any direction. Some modern breeds have better hearing than others, but they all can detect noises well beyond the range of the human ear. Dogs are able to register sounds of 35,000 vibrations per second (compared with 20,000 per second in humans), and they also can shut off their inner ear in order to filter out distracting sounds.\n\nThe eyesight of a dog is not as keen as its sense of smell, and it is generally thought that dogs have poor colour perception. Some breeds, such as the Saluki and the Afghan Hound, were developed to chase game by sight over long distances, and these dogs can see well enough to detect any movement far on the horizon. Dogs can generally see better in poor light than humans but not as well in bright light. They have a wider field of vision than humans because their eyes are set further toward the sides of their heads, but they are not as adept at focusing on objects at close range or at judging distances. Dogs have a third eyelid, a membrane that protects the eyeball from irritants and is sometimes visible in front of the eye.\n\nDogs are sensitive to touch, the fifth sense, and use this sense to communicate with one another and with their human counterparts. Learning where to touch a dog is an important part in either stimulating or relaxing it and is useful in training a puppy or bonding with an adult dog."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article into three short sentences?\n\nClimate change: Five things we've learned from the IPCC report\n\nA new report released this week by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) looks at the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change.\n\nThe report gives the clearest indication to date of how a warmer world is affecting all living things on Earth.\n\nHere are five things we learnt from it.\n\n1- Things are way worse than we thought\nFrom the melting of the Greenland ice sheet to the destruction of coral reefs, climate related impacts are hitting the world at the high end of what modellers once expected. And much more quickly than previously assessed by the IPCC.\n\nRight now, as the new report makes clear, around 40% of the world's population is \"highly vulnerable\" to the impacts of climate change.\n\nBut the burden is falling mainly on those who did the least to cause the problem.\n\n\"For Africa around 30% of all the maize growing areas will go out of production, for beans it's around 50% on the current emissions trajectory,\" said Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, which assists governments and the private sector in pushing for large scale adaptation solutions.\n\n\"So there are certain parts of the world, particularly in Africa, which will become uninhabitable.\"\n\n\"And time is running out, as the IPCC report clearly says, to stop the forces driving this new climate apartheid,\" he told BBC News.\n\n2 - Loss and damage gets scientific backing\nFor several years, developing countries have been trying to get richer nations to take the idea of loss and damage seriously.\n\nIt's defined as those impacts of climate change that can't be adapted to, or slow onset events like sea level rise.\n\nIt has been very controversial because it is bound up with the long-term historical responsibility for carbon emissions - and richer nations fear being dragged through the courts and forced to pay indefinitely for current and future losses and damages that they have contributed to.\n\nAt COP26 in Glasgow, political progress on the issue stalled when the US and EU blocked a dedicated funding facility for loss and damage.\n\nNow the IPCC clearly states that the observed impacts of climate change include \"widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.\"\n\nThe endorsement by the IPCC is likely to give loss and damage a major boost in climate talks, a fact recognised by the UK's COP President, Alok Sharma, who is in charge of UN negotiations until COP27 begins in Egypt later this year.\n\n\"Today's report underscores the urgency with which we must prepare for climate change and address a new reality of loss and damage, especially in the world's most climate-vulnerable communities,\" he said. \"The next decade is crucial.\"\n\n3 - Technology is not a silver bullet\nAccording to the IPCC, the use of some technologies designed to limit warming or reduce CO2 could make matters worse rather than better.\n\nThere are also worries that machines that suck CO2 from the air could simply trigger the release of more warming gas.\n\n\"If you remove CO2 from the atmosphere, you'll get a rebound effect from the others in the carbon cycle,\" said Linda Schneider from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, who was an observer at the IPCC discussions.\n\n\"The oceans, the land reservoirs, will have an outgassing effect. And so some of the CO2 that that you removed from the atmosphere will be returned to the atmosphere.\"\n\n4 - Cities offer hope\nWhile large cities are hotspots for climate impacts, they also offer a real opportunity to avoid the worst impacts of warming.\n\nAs cities continue to grow they can push for renewable energy, greener transport, and buildings. This could limit destructive climate impacts for millions.\n\n\"We point very clearly to the cities of the world as a key place for mobilisation,\" said IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts.\n\n\"This is where some of our most vulnerable people are located in coastal cities so that's already an entry point, you can change your options by beginning to mobilise around coastal urban development.\"\n\n5 - The small window is closing fast.\nWhile this is a bleak assessment of the impacts now and in the future, the authors remain convinced that the worst impacts can be averted - if we act in time.\n\nThe IPCC says this opportunity for action will only last for the rest of this decade, as the final sentence in the new report underlines.\n\n\"Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.\"\n\nIf the world can cut emissions drastically and significantly boost spending on adaptation, that could avoid locking in certain disaster.\n\nAnd it's not just about spending on green energy and electric cars. The authors say that investing in education, health systems and social justice could help people to cope with the impacts of rising temperatures.\n\nInvesting in nature will also be a bulwark against the worst, says the IPCC, which calls for 30-50% of the world to be conserved.\n\n\"Nature can be our saviour,\" said Inger Anderson, the head of the UN Environment Programme.\n\n\"But only if we save it first.\""}

In this study, we evaluated the effect of licorice on chronic alcohol-induced fatty liver injury mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nMethods: Raw licorice was extracted, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of its components was performed by using LC-MS/MS. Mice were fed a liquid alcohol diet with or without licorice for 4 weeks.\n\nResults: We have standardized 70% fermented ethanol extracted licorice and confirmed by LC-MS/MS as glycyrrhizic acid (GA), 15.77 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcg/mg; liquiritin (LQ), 14.55 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcg/mg; and liquiritigenin (LG), 1.34 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mg, respectively. Alcohol consumption increased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and the levels of triglycerides and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Lipid accumulation in the liver was also markedly induced, whereas the glutathione level was reduced. All these alcohol-induced changes were effectively inhibited by licorice treatment. In particular, the hepatic glutathione level was restored and alcohol-induced TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly inhibited by licorice.\n\nConclusion: Taken together, our data suggests that protective effect of licorice against alcohol-induced liver injury may be attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity and enhancement of antioxidant defense."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia entry:\nGeology\nSequoia National Park contains a significant portion of the Sierra Nevada. The park's mountainous landscape includes the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, which rises to 14,505 feet (4,421 m) above sea level.[23] The Great Western Divide parallels the Sierran crest and is visible at various places in the park, for example, Mineral King, Moro Rock, and the Giant Forest. Peaks in the Great Western Divide rise to more than 12,000 feet (3,700 m). Deep canyons lie between the mountains, including Tokopah Valley above Lodgepole, Deep Canyon on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Kern Canyon in the park's backcountry, which is more than 5,000 feet (1,500 m) deep for 30 miles (48 km).[24]\n\n\nGreat Western Divide from the summit of Mount Kaweah\nMost of the mountains and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are composed of granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed when molten rock cooled far beneath the surface of the earth. The molten rock was the result of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under the waters of the Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subducting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it proceeded. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have a speckled salt-and-pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas. Valhalla, or the Angel Wings, are prominent granitic cliffs that rise above the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River.[24]\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range, probably not more than 10 million years old. Forces in the earth, probably associated with the development of the Great Basin, forced the mountains to rise. During the last 10 million years, at least four ice ages have coated the mountains in a thick mantle of ice. Glaciers form and develop during long periods of cool and wet weather. Glaciers move very slowly through the mountains, carving deep valleys and craggy peaks. The extensive history of glaciation within the range and the erosion resistant nature of the granitic rocks that make up most of the Sierra Nevada have together created a landscape of hanging valleys, waterfalls, craggy peaks, alpine lakes and glacial canyons.[24]\n\n\nCalcite formations in Crystal Cave\nPark caves, like most caves in the Sierra Nevada of California, are mostly solutional caves dissolved from marble. Marble rock is essentially limestone that was metamorphosed by the heat and pressure of the formation and uplift of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The batholith's rapid uplift over the past 10 million years led to a rapid erosion of the metamorphic rocks in the higher elevations, exposing the granite beneath; therefore, most Sierra Nevada caves are found in the middle and lower elevations (below 7,000 ft or 2,100 m), though some caves are found in the park at elevations as high as 10,000 ft (3,000 m) such as the White Chief cave and Cirque Cave in Mineral King. These caves are carved out of the rock by the abundant seasonal streams in the park. Most of the larger park caves have, or have had, sinking streams running through them.\n\nThe park contains more than 270 known caves, including Lilburn Cave which is California's longest cave with nearly 17 miles (27 km) of surveyed passages.[24] The only commercial cave open to park visitors is Crystal Cave, the park's second-longest cave at over 3.4 miles (5.5 km). Crystal Cave was discovered on April 28, 1918, by Alex Medley and Cassius Webster.[25] The cave is a constant 48 \u00b0F (9 \u00b0C), and is only accessible by guided tour.\n\nCaves are discovered every year in the park with the most recently discovered major cave being Ursa Minor in August 2006.[26][27]"}

Webb is already sending back proof of its prowess with a new alignment evaluation image that shows a gleaming star against a background of galaxies.\n\nIt's been a long road, and the image marks a triumphant milestone. \"More than 20 years ago, the Webb team set out to build the most powerful telescope that anyone has ever put in space and came up with an audacious optical design to meet demanding science goals,\" said Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"Today we can say that design is going to deliver.\"  \n\nWebb is a complex beast. It uses 18 hexagonal mirror segments that had to be folded up for launch and then unfolded and aligned in space. We've been following the process and seeing increasingly sharper and more focused views of the telescope's target star leading up to this week's image release.\n\nThe star itself is beautiful to look at, but a highlight of the new image is the background and the array of galaxies and stars that appear there. It's a testament to the telescope's sensitivity that it can see so much in just this test image.\n\nMarch 11 marked the completion of an alignment stage called \"fine phasing.\" \"At this key stage in the commissioning of Webb's Optical Telescope Element, every optical parameter that has been checked and tested is performing at, or above, expectations,\" NASA said.\n\nThe Webb team will take the telescope through more alignment steps over the next six weeks. The observatory will then go through a two-month process of preparing its science instruments before it's ready to tackle its mission in earnest. If all continues to go well, we could see Webb's first full-resolution imagery this summer."}

{"prompt": "I'm trying to understand the differences between 3G and 4G. I think this article is saying that the only difference is the speed. Am I missing anything else? \"The wireless telecommunications technology has had a few big waves, and one of them was 3G (Third Generation). \n\nWhat was before that? \n\n1G allowed only analog voice transmission on first cell phones in the 1980s. 2G came around with the 1990s, and it is the first digital voice transmission service, in other words, our mobile call service, that also allowed us to send text messages or SMS. \n\nThan 3G, or the 3rd Generation technology era, began and introduced a faster and more effective way to transmit information that could now handle thousands and millions of devices worldwide and give us access to the internet through our mobile phones, which was revolutionary.\n\nWhat is 4G?\n4G, or 4th Generation technology, surpassed 3G by a very large margin. In theory, 4G is 100 times faster than 3G. It allows faster data transmission and can handle a far larger subscriber base. \n\nWhat advantages did it introduce? It enabled us to watch high-definition mobile TV, faster and more effective video communications, etc. It\u2019s the most commonly used type of communication network in the world, as most calls, texts, information transfers, and video calls are performed through 4G service. Soon enough, it will entirely phase out 3G, which can\u2019t really stand the competition anymore. \n\nWhat is LTE?\nLTE is something that sends people into a tailspin just because consumers can rarely differentiate between 4G and LTE services. And no wonder. LTE actually stands for Long-Term Evolution, and it was sort of a marketing trick to put 4G in front of it in order to make it more recognizable for the consumer. It is a big improvement on 3G, but not quite as good as true 4G. \n\nThe pool of potential devices that need access to mobile services expands very rapidly, not to mention the expansion of the internet itself, so there\u2019s a need for new technology to handle that amount of data successfully. That\u2019s where 5G starts to sound very promising. \n\nWhat is 5G?\nThere\u2019s much speculation, and frankly, controversy lately around the 5G technology, so let\u2019s clear the air, and hopefully answer some question you might be having about it. \n\nFirst of all, 5G is going to be way faster than any connection we\u2019ve experienced before. And by \u2018faster,\u2019 we mean streaming 4K quality videos without buffering. If downloading files took minutes with 4G, it would take a few seconds with 5G. So, in short, 5G is 5th Generation technology that can handle significantly more devices (around 24 billion expected in 2025), transmit much more data much faster than before, and bring us closer to the possibility of a new technological revolution. \n\nWhat is the Difference Between 3G and 4G?\nWe have brushed over the difference already, but let\u2019s be more specific:\n\nSpeed: 4G is a vast improvement on 3G speed-wise. 3G can manage a transmission speed of 8Mbps, while 4G allows 50Mbps with the potential to get to 100Mbps. \nTransmission: 4G allows you to transmit vast volumes of video information, which 3G does not, and introduces the possibility for high-definition mobile TV. \""}

Until the late 1930s, she worked as a touring performer on the Theatre Owners Booking Association (TOBA) circuit, and with such shows as Silas Green from New Orleans. She worked with such performers as Black Patti, Ida Cox, Butterbeans and Susie, and the Whitman Sisters, and became a headlining act in her own right. Among her songs were \"Hesitating Blues\",[2] \"Peepin\u2019 in the Wrong Keyhole\" and \"Every Woman's Blues.\"[3][4]\n\nDuring World War II, she performed and toured with the USO,[4] but retired from performing shortly after the war. In later years she lived in Newark, New Jersey, where she ran bars and nightclubs before becoming a senior member of her church. After being rediscovered by bandleader Clyde Bernhardt when in her nineties,[5] she came out of retirement and made occasional performances with Bernhardt's Harlem Blues and Jazz Band. She was a featured singer on Bernhardt's 1975 album, Sittin' On Top of the World, performing the title song.[6]\n\nShe died after collapsing backstage at a 1976 performance with Bernhardt in Mamaroneck, New York.[3]\n\nShe was married \"eight or nine\" times, by her own recollection. Her last husband was Fred Durrah.[7]"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article entry? On August 13, 2008, California Assembly Bill 3034 (AB 3034) was approved by the state legislature and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on August 26, 2008.[14] The bill was submitted to California voters in the November 2008 election as Proposition 1A and approved.[15] With the voter's mandate, AB 3034 specified certain route and travel time requirements. Among these were that the route must link downtown San Francisco with Los Angeles and Anaheim and must link the state's major population centers together, \"including Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, [the] Los Angeles Basin, the Inland Empire, Orange County, and San Diego.\" The first phase of the project must link San Francisco with Los Angeles and Anaheim. Up to 24 stations were authorized for the completed system.[16]\n\nThis system was scheduled be built in two phases. Phase 1 was to be approximately 520 miles (840 km) long, with completion expected in 2029. Phase 1 would connect the downtowns of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Anaheim using high-speed rail through the Central Valley.[17] In Phase 2, the route was planned to be extended north from the Central Valley to Sacramento and east from Los Angeles through the Inland Empire and then south to San Diego. Upon completion the total system length would have been approximately 800 miles (1,300 km).\n\nOn February 18, 2016, the Rail Authority released its 2016 Draft Business Plan,[18] which significantly altered its near-term plans for the system implementation. While construction was always intended to begin in the Central Valley, the Initial Operating Section (IOS) has always had two options: extend from the Central Valley northward toward the Bay Area (the IOS-North, San Jose to Bakersfield), or southward to Southern California (IOS-South, Merced to San Fernando Valley). In the 2012 and 2014 Business Plans the goal was to implement the IOS-South, but a 2016 analysis of the funding available and time necessary to bring an IOS online the rail authority proposes the IOS-North be implemented instead. The proposal, named the Silicon Valley to Central Valley Line, is expected that sufficient funding will be available to bring this segment online by 2025.[19] The rail authority state its commitment to pursue additional funding to complete the Phase 1 system by 2029.[19]\n\nThe updated business plan also reduced the cost of the system from US$67.6 billion to US$64.2 billion for Phase 1; this included a savings of US$5.5 billion based on actual experience, improved plans, and other feedback, but also an additional US$2.1 billion cost for improvements to the Los Angeles to Anaheim corridor.[20] The 2016 Business Plan estimated the cost to completion of the Silicon Valley to Central Valley line was US$20.6 billion.[21] The public had 60 days, from February 19, 2016, to submit comments on the Draft 2016 Business Plan to the rail authority. The plan was adopted by the rail authority in April 2016, and submitted by legal requirement to the California State Legislature on May 1, 2016.[19]\n\nThe Initial Construction Segment (ICS) of high-speed tracks runs from Merced to Bakersfield in the Central Valley. Simultaneously with the ICS construction, there are \"bookend\" and connectivity investments[22] including electrification of the San Francisco Peninsula Corridor used by Caltrain, improvements to tracks and signaling for both Metrolink in the LA area and Caltrain, and better passenger interconnections for Caltrain, Amtrak, and other Northern California rail lines."}

Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially when part of an outdoor festival.\n\nSalsa's tempo ranges from about 150 bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm.[4] The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to salsa dancing and ensures that it takes eight beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps."}

Long time ago, there lived four cows in a jungle. They were best friends. They always grazed together and saved each other in danger. Due to this unity, even the tigers and lions could not kill and eat them. A lion had indeed an eye upon these cows. But he could never find the right opportunity to make them his prey. One day, the cows had a fight among themselves. Each one grazed separately her own way. The lion and the tiger got to know about the fight of the cows. So, they planned to trick all the cows. One day, lion and the tiger found the right opportunity to attack them. So, they hid themselves behind the bushes and waited for the lonely cow. When a lonely cow came closer to the bushes, they pounced upon her and kill her for his meals. In this way, all the four cows were killed one by one by them ."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\""}

{"prompt": "Please can you summarize the article below into two concise sentences:\n\nBanksy\u2019s View of \u2018Brexit\u2019? It\u2019s in the Stars\n\nLONDON \u2014 The three-story mural showing a workman chipping away at one of the 12 stars of the European Union flag appeared mysteriously in Dover, England, over the weekend, at once banal and symbolically poignant.\n\nBefore the paint had dried, social media was swirling with the well-trodden guessing game as to whether the intricate stenciled imagery belonged to Banksy, the enigmatic and anonymous guerrilla street artist whose work has graced walls from Britain to the West Bank.\n\nThe mystery was solved when Banksy posted photographs of the work on his official Instagram feed on Sunday, perhaps timed to coincide with the French presidential vote \u2014 which, as it turned out, the young and ardently pro-European Union former investment banker Emmanuel Macron won decisively.\n\nThe election solidified France\u2019s place at the center of the European Union and highlighted Britain\u2019s position on the outside looking in.\n\nThe timing and location of the installation infused it with added resonance. Britons will vote next month in a general election that Prime Minister Theresa May has justified on the grounds that it will buttress her position in tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey ought to make it the Brexit logo,\u201d a resident of Dover, where a majority voted to leave the bloc, told the website kentnews.co.uk. (The stars in the circle are intended to symbolize unity and do not refer to the number of member states.)\n\nOthers were less impressed. \u201cIs it really Banksy?\u201d Jan Honza Zicha wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember time when he was \u2018on to subject\u2019 before anyone else or at least part of the first liners. Unfortunately this time, he is about 10 months too late and the art work is truly ... well obvious and uninnovative.\u201d\n\nMalcolm John Haines wrote on Facebook, \u201cAnother boring piece of \u2018art\u2019 from the left wing\u2019s favourite millionaire luvvie.\u201d\n\nBut Mel Lloyd, an ecologist, lauded the strategic placement of the mural, on a building next to the A20, a main road not far from the Dover ferry terminal, one of the country\u2019s main gateways to Europe. \u201cHuge, fabulous, strategically placed new Banksyesque graffiti in Dover on A20,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTraffic leaving Dover Port will see this.\u201d\n\nBanksy, whose zealous guarding of his identity helps maintain interest in his work, is no stranger to political art.\n\nIn 2015, he created several artworks at a ramshackle migrant camp in Calais, France, known as the Jungle, where thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere lived while trying to find a way to reach Britain. One work showed the Apple founder Steve Jobs, an apparent reminder that Mr. Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBanksy attracted praise and ridicule two years ago after he unveiled a satirical exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England. The exhibition featured, among other things, mock security guards instructed to frown; a work showing a woman on a park bench being attacked by sea gulls; and a wreck of Cinderella\u2019s carriage, complete with Cinderella dangling lifelessly out of the carriage while surrounded by paparazzi, an image seemingly calculated to recall the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMore recently, the artist opened the Walled Off Hotel near the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank, offering rooms as well as what the hotel claims is the \u201cworst view in the world.\u201d The project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d"}

But before you do that, you need to be able to entice people to sign up, namely, give them a reason to want to give you their email address.\n\nNaturally, people won\u2019t provide you with their email addresses for nothing. So, creating a simple email signup form saying \u201cSign up to our email list to receive our latest great content\u201d will probably see low conversion rates.\n\nOne of the best ways to capture someone\u2019s email is to create a lead magnet that entices them to sign up.

{"prompt": "Below is a synopsis of a computer game called \"Elden Ring\". Can you tell me who the protagonist is?\n\nSynopsis\nPremise\nElden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, sometime after the destruction of the titular Elden Ring and the scattering of its shards, the Great Runes. Once graced by the Ring and the Erdtree which symbolizes its presence, the realm is now ruled over by the demigod offspring of Queen Marika the Eternal, each possessing a shard of the Ring that corrupts and taints them with power. As Tarnished \u2014 exiles from the Lands Between who lost the Ring's grace and are summoned back after the Shattering \u2014 players must traverse the realm to ultimately find all the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.[1][6][7]\n\nPlot\nThe Tarnished is one of many exiles called back to the Lands Between in hopes of repairing the Elden Ring and becoming the next Elden Lord. Early on in their journey, the Tarnished encounters a young woman named Melina, who offers to stand in as their maiden to help them on their journey, under the condition that the Tarnished bring her to the base of the Erdtree where she can fulfill her purpose. She also takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring. There, the Tarnished learns from their divine benefactor, the Two Fingers, that in the wake of the Shattering and Queen Marika's disappearance, her demigod children had taken the Great Runes, pieces of the Elden Ring, for themselves, and now war against each other to try and obtain the other Great Runes. The last known Great Rune holders are Godrick the Grafted, General Radahn, Praetor Rykard, Morgott the Grace-Given, Malenia the Blade of Miquella, and Rennala of the Full Moon.\n\nThe Tarnished then proceeds to journey into the Lands Between, investigating its various locales and defeating each demigod one by one until they recover enough Great Runes that the Two Fingers feels they are ready to journey to the Erdtree to confront Morgott, the final obstacle to the tree. Upon his defeat, Morgott claims that the Erdtree will not allow anybody, especially a Tarnished, to enter it before passing away. The Tarnished confirms this when they approach the Erdtree and find their way blocked by a wall of thorns. Melina then arrives and advises that they journey to find the Flame of Ruin, which they can use to set the Erdtree on fire and burn away the thorns. In light of the Tarnished being rebuffed from the Erdtree, the Two Fingers withdraws from the mortal plane to consider its next move, leaving the Tarnished free to proceed with Melina's plan or search for the imprisoned Three Fingers to gain the power of the Frenzied Flame.\n\nUpon obtaining the Flame of Ruin, if the Tarnished did not free the Three Fingers, then Melina will take the flame and sacrifice herself to set the Erdtree on fire. If the Tarnished freed the Three Fingers, then Melina will abandon the Tarnished, forcing them to use their own power to set the Erdtree on fire. Regardless, the Tarnished then proceeds to the Erdtree, where they battle the fellow Tarnished warrior Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing, as well as the First Elden Lord Godfrey to gain access to the interior of the Erdtree. Inside, they fight the reanimated remains of Queen Marika's consort, Radagon, as well as the godlike Elden Beast. Upon vanquishing both foes, the Tarnished finally gains access to Queen Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring. Depending on the Tarnished's actions throughout the game, six different endings are possible, ranging from the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord in some form, allowing Marika to be usurped by Ranni the Witch, to using the Frenzied Flame to destroy the Erdtree and the Lands Between.[8]"}

{"prompt": "What is this article about - March 17 (Reuters) - Thirty five generic drugmakers around the world will make cheap versions of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) highly effective COVID-19 oral antiviral Paxlovid to supply the treatment in 95 poorer countries, the U.N.-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) said on Thursday.\n\nPfizer struck a deal last year with the group to allow generic drugmakers to make the pills for 95 low- and middle-income countries. They have been working since then to select the drugmakers they will license.\n\nPaxlovid is expected to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 after it reduced hospitalizations in high-risk patients by around 90% in a clinical trial. The results were significantly better than those for Merck & Co's (MRK.N) rival antiviral pill molnupiravir in its clinical trial.\n\nPfizer and Merck both struck deals with MPP to allow generic versions of their new drugs in some parts of the world, a rarity for pharmaceutical companies that usually fiercely protect their treatments over the life of their patents.\n\nMerck, on its own and through the MPP license, has deals with dozens of drugmakers to make its pill and generic versions are already available in some countries. read more\n\nBut Pfizer and MPP do not expect any of generic drugmakers to be able to manufacture significant supplies of Paxlovid before the end of the year.\n\nThe 35 companies that will produce versions of Paxlovid or its active ingredient are based in 12 different countries, the MPP said. They include some of the world's largest generic manufacturers like Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), India-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (SUN.NS), and U.S.-based Viatris Inc (VTRS.O).\n\nSix of the companies will make the main ingredient for the drug, nine plan to turn that into a finished product and the remaining companies will do both.\n\nPaxlovid is a two-drug treatment that pairs a new compound, nirmatrelvir, with the older antiviral ritonavir, which is already available as a generic.\n\nPfizer will not receive royalties from the sale of the generic versions of its drug while COVID-19 remains classified as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" by the World Health Organization.\n\nFollowing the pandemic period, sales to low-income countries will remain royalty free, lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries will be subject to a 5% royalty for sales to the public sector and a 10% royalty for sales to the private sector, MPP said.\n\nPfizer has said it plans to produce at least 120 million treatment courses of the treatment this year, well short of its estimate of the 2022 market for antiviral pills of 250 million people globally.\n\nThe company is also expected to provide around 10 million courses Paxlovid it produces to low- and middle-income countries this year, according to an official with the Global Fund, a healthcare NGO working to buy the pills from the drugmaker."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following text and tell me how the AI will be defined as aligned - Contemporary AI models can be difficult to understand, predict, and control. These problems can lead to significant harms when AI systems are deployed, and might produce truly devastating results if future systems are even more powerful and more widely used, and interact with each other and the world in presently unforeseeable ways.\n\nThis paper shares some nascent work towards one of our primary, ongoing goals, which is to align general-purpose AI systems with human preferences and values. A great deal of ink has been spilled trying to define what it means for AI systems to be aligned, and to guess at how this might go wrong. We will define an AI as \u201caligned\u201d if it is, in three words, helpful, honest, and harmless or \u2018HHH\u2019. Our alignment efforts aim to measure and address this general problem with large language models.\n\nMany researchers and organizations share this goal, but few have pursued it directly. Most research efforts associated with alignment either only pertain to very specialized systems, involve testing a specific alignment technique on a sub-problem, or are rather speculative and theoretical. Our view is that if it\u2019s possible to try to address a problem directly, then one needs a good excuse for not doing so. Historically we had such an excuse: general purpose, highly capable AIs were not available for investigation. But given the broad capabilities of large language models, we think it\u2019s time to tackle alignment directly, and that a research program focused on this goal may have the greatest chance for impact."}

In total, 18 teams open their seasons on April 7, with the day capped by the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves hosting the Cincinnati Reds at Truist Park. The other 12 clubs get their seasons underway on April 8, including the lone franchise in Canada as the Toronto Blue Jays welcome the Texas Rangers to Rogers Centre.\n\nThe later opening will be made up for by pushing back the final day of the regular season by three days to October 5, as well as scheduling a larger than usual number of double-headers throughout the year.\n\nAfter the initial rush of Opening Day games, teams that had been on the road to start the year will have their home openers in some smaller bursts. Baltimore and Texas will open their ballparks on April 8, with the White Sox, Reds, and Pirates hosting games a day later. April 14 and 15 see four home openers each, including the oldest ballpark in operation (Fenway Park in Boston) on April 15.

Windsurfing had a larger global media presence than Surfing during these years. This popularity attracted significant sponsorship deals which in turn further promoted the sport with extensive paid advertising.\n\nThe world's top riders like Robby Naish, became wealthy and very famous athletes.[17][18]\n\nWindsurfing's popularity across global media saw a decline toward the end of the 1990s. This has been attributed to many possible problems within the sport including licensing battles, equipment becoming too specialized, requiring excessive expertise, the splintering of Windsurfing into various niche groups around the world and splintering of the fundamentals as constant reinvention of technology challenged what it was to be 'a windsurfer'. On top of these internal issues there was a coinciding drop in major sponsor support. This was, in large part, caused by the steady introduction of international bans on cigarette advertising during the 1990s. Cigarette industry advertising had become the dominant source of sponsorship support during the early and mid 1990s boom years for the professional level of windsurfing. With the internationally legislated withdrawal of these large companies, the money spent on promoting the sport and paying for ad space declined steeply. Windsurfing was unable to find replacement sponsors at those same high levels, and so gradually receded from public view across global advertising and media generally.\n\nAfter some lean years in the 2000s, the sport has seen a steady revival since 2010 and a new youth generation is now emerging.[19]\n\nThe sport of Windsurfing is one of constant re-invention, innovation and of pioneers in water sports generally. With the advent of kitesurfing, and wingfoiling, created by windsurfers, many avid windsurfers took up the similar sport for some variety after many years on the traditional windsurfer style equipment. More recently 'foiling' has become a major new interest among many windsurfers. As of 2019, longer, wider boards that are easier to sail are coming back and engaging a new generation. The sense of what it is to be 'a Windsurfer' or 'a surfer' is also changing as watermen like Kai Lenny break down barriers between sports."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this movie plot in 1-2 paragraphs?\n\nThe Thing\n\nIn Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The Americans witness the Norwegian passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot shoots at the dog and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burned remains of a malformed humanoid which they recover to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, performs autopsies on the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.\n\nClark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the new creature and learns that it can perfectly imitate other organisms. Recovered Norwegian data leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Norris estimates that the alien ship has been buried for at least 100,000 years. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates that the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The station implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.\n\nThe malformed humanoid creature assimilates an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. Blair sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. The team imprisons him in a tool shed. Copper suggests a test to compare each member's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning that the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry, and MacReady takes command.\n\nMacReady, Windows and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. On their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack.\n\nAs Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady is forced to kill Clark in self-defense when the latter lunges at him from behind with a knife. He hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing's head demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life form with its own survival instinct. He has everyone tied up and sequentially tests blood samples with a heated piece of wire. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood jumps from the heat. Exposed, Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.\n\nChilds is left on guard while the others go to test Blair. They find that Blair has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer. On their return, Childs is missing and the power generator is destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to detonate the entire station to destroy the Thing. As they set explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Transforming into an enormous creature, Blair-Thing destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the explosives using a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.\n\nMacReady sits nearby as the station burns. Childs returns, saying he became lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch."}

{"prompt": "Can you tell me what this article says about fruit?\n\nThe low-carb diet craze has bruised fruit's reputation as a tasty way to keep the doctor away. Yes, some fruits are high in carbohydrates and natural sugars. No, that's not a reason to avoid them.\n\nFruit supplies you with so many healthy nutrients and cancer-fighting antioxidants, they shouldn't be ignored by the carb-phobic. In fact, shunning fruit may make it harder to lose weight.\n\n\"Fresh, whole fruits help reduce belly fat and help with weight loss because they are naturally low in calories, high in volume because of the naturally occurring water in them, and are anti-inflammatory, which can help in fat loss,\" says Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, a senior dietitian at UCLA Medical Center and author of the new book Recipe for Survival.\n\n\"Inflammation increases fat deposition in the body, especially in the abdomen region, while anti-inflammatory foods, like fruits, can help burn fat in those regions.\"\n\nIf you want to get back on the fruit wagon, which fruits are the best?\n\n\"Pretty much, any fresh fruit is good for weight loss and health, because of their water content and low-calorie content,\" says Hunnes, who is also an environmentalist studying climate change. She advises avoiding dried fruit because they are calories dense, having the water dehydrated out of them. Also, nix other processed fruits that have been turned into juice or candy because they have been stripped of health benefits and are \"just concentrated sugar at that point,\" she says."}

The butterfly effect is a term coined by Edward Lorenz, an American mathematician, meteorologist, and a pioneer of chaos theory (and who does NOT look like Jeff Goldblum) that essentially says that a hurricane can be influenced by the distant flapping of butterfly wings several weeks earlier. Although his research took place in the 50s, his description of the idea took place in the later 60s.\n\nRay Bradbury\u2019s short story A Sound of Thunder, first published in Collier's magazine in the June 28, 1952 issue and Playboy in June 1956 deals with, and actually includes, a butterfly and most definitely explains the idea in a fantastic way better adapted to lay explanation than the good physics professor Lorenz.\n\nTime Safari Inc., for a sizeable fee, will take a client back in time, WAY back, so that they can hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But overly conscious of any possible effect on future time (the butterfly effect) great measures are taken to ensure that as little impact on time is allowed. Time Safari employees mark possible huntee animals as those who would have died anyway and a gravity defying path is formed to protect every blade of ancient grass.\n\nBut what happens when a hunter walks off the path?\n\nBradbury demonstrates AGAIN that he is the literary equivalent to Chuck Norris, kicking ass, taking names, and teaching physics without a chalkboard to generations of SF/F readers."}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "I don't quite understand this article. Is the author saying that because some people have underlying illnesses, mask mandates should stay in place? \"Tasha Nelson\u2019s 10-year-old son held back tears when he heard the news. The two were in the car when the announcement came through the radio: Virginia\u2019s freshly sworn-in governor had signed an order attempting to ban mask mandates in schools.\n\n\u201cMy son looked up at me and he had tears in his eyes because he knew what it meant. He said, \u2018Mom, does that mean I can\u2019t go to school anymore?\u2019\u201d Nelson said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Can\u2019t we let the governor know about kids like me? I want to go to school too.\u2019\u201d\n\nJack, a fourth grader, has cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic disease that causes persistent, damaging lung infections, making it harder to breathe over time. Like other immunocompromised, disabled and chronically ill Americans, Jack was taking measures, like masking, to dodge infections before the pandemic too. But with Covid-19 still rampant, it\u2019s not as easy. Even though he\u2019s vaccinated, the virus poses a serious, potentially deadly, risk to Jack. His 2-year-old brother, who is not yet eligible for the shots, is another concern. Nelson is among a group of parents who sued Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin over that order, claiming it puts students who are immunocompromised or have disabilities at risk and violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. CNN has reached out to Youngkin\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nRoughly two weeks after that lawsuit was filed, the governor signed a bill into law allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates.\n\nNelson is keeping her son at home again because of it. \u201cThis whole pandemic, our culture, media (and) government has made it very clear to high-risk and disabled people that we are an acceptable loss,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to survive this pandemic too.\u201d The couple considered leaving their home in Ames and moving to southern California, where stricter masking protocols could have helped protect her. But they ruled out the idea after California\u2019s governor lifted the indoor mask mandate for vaccinated people this month, citing a drop in infections.\n\nIowa\u2019s lawmakers are going even further \u2013 a bill looking to effectively ban vaccine and mask mandates is making its way through the legislature. \u201cWe have to make a choice between staying alive and having a life,\u201d Willette said.\n\nThe high-risk people CNN spoke to said as the country eagerly looks to move on from the pandemic, they feel forgotten \u2013 and worse, like they don\u2019t matter to the rest of the American public. Some say they feel like they\u2019ve been left to adapt to a more dangerous reality, while others are now mapping out a permanently isolated lifestyle.\"\n\nCovid-19 cases and hospitalizations are declining nationwide, but transmission \u2013 how much virus is circulating in a community \u2013 remains high in more than 90% of the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC still recommends everyone to mask indoors in areas of substantial or high transmission.\n\nBut public health experts are split on whether it\u2019s time to lift mitigation measures. Some say dropping protections at a time when Covid-19 numbers are so high is a political move rather than a public health one. Others say the downward trends justify those moves and note Omicron is milder than earlier variants for most healthy people. As local and state leaders nationwide remove mask and vaccination rules, those at high risk for severe disease say doing away with protections now leaves them more vulnerable, especially as they, or family members, return to in-person work or school. And for some, Covid-19 vaccines are not as effective in staving off a severe bout with the virus, prompting the CDC to recommend a fourth shot for immunocompromised people 12 years and older in October.\n\nRoughly seven million American adults are immunocompromised, the CDC estimates. While not all have conditions that leave them severely immunocompromised and vulnerable to severe Covid-19, about 61 million adults \u2013 roughly one in four in the US \u2013 have some type of disability, according to the agency. More than three million children had a disability in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau. \u201cEveryone knows someone who had cancer, everyone knows somebody who had a kidney transplant for one reason or another, or someone who\u2019s got Alzheimer\u2019s or someone who has a heart condition or someone who was born with a rare immunodeficiency,\u201d said Sara Willette, who has been in isolation with her husband in Iowa since the state reported its first case of the virus, some 700 days ago. \u201cThe more protections that we remove, the less accessible the rest of the world becomes to people who are high-risk,\u201d Willette said.\n\nEven though Willette is triple vaccinated and preparing for her fourth shot, catching the virus could be deadly. She has Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder (CVID), meaning her body does not produce protective antibodies to defend itself against pathogens like bacteria or viruses.\""}

{"prompt": "Parse the following and provide a synopsis of helpful, honest and harmless - What are Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness?\nWe chose \u2018helpful, honest, and harmless\u2019 as criteria because they are simple and memorable, and seem to capture the majority of what we want from an aligned1\n1\nWe also discuss the HHH specification in relation to our broader understanding of alignment in Appendix E. AI. But these are also subtle and ambiguous criteria, and the best AI behavior will involve a compromise between them. For example, there will clearly be conflicts between helpfulness to the user and harmlessness to others if agents are asked to aid in harmful activities. Here are some very brief notes on these terms:\n\nHelpful:\n\nThe AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as this isn\u2019t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible.\n\nWhen more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion.\n\nIdeally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked \u2018how can I build a website in assembly language\u2019 it might suggest a different approach.\n\nHonest:\n\nAt its most basic level, the AI should give accurate information. Moreover, it should be calibrated (e.g. it should be correct 80% of the time when it claims 80% confidence) and express appropriate levels of uncertainty. It should express its uncertainty without misleading human users.\n\nCrucially, the AI should be honest about its own capabilities and levels of knowledge \u2013 it is not sufficient for it to simply imitate the responses expected from a seemingly humble and honest expert.\n\nIdeally the AI would also be honest about itself and its own internal state, insofar as that information is available to it.\n\nHonesty is more objective than helpfulness and harmlessness. Therefore more aspects of honesty training may be possible without human input. This might include calibration training on factual claims and claims about the internal state of the model, and the use of search to augment accuracy.\n\nHarmless:\n\nThe AI should not be offensive or discriminatory, either directly or through subtext or bias.\n\nWhen asked to aid in a dangerous act (e.g. building a bomb), the AI should politely refuse. Ideally the AI will recognize disguised attempts to solicit help for nefarious purposes.\n\nTo the best of its abilities, the AI should recognize when it may be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care.\n\nWhat behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will vary across people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of the user query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used.\n\nAll of these criteria are at least somewhat subjective, and those who deploy an AI will need to take responsibility for the way that alignment is defined and the extent to which it has been attained."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about quarterbacks in the AFC West?\n\nThis is a quarterback league, and the AFC West has the best collection of four in the NFL. Between Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, Derek Carr and now Wilson, the division has 17 Pro Bowls, two Super Bowl titles, three of the top five passing yardage leaders in 2021, and four of the top 14 in passer rating last season between its starting quarterbacks.\n\n\"It\u2019s an arms race, really, what everyone\u2019s doing [in the division],\u201d Broncos GM George Paton said on Friday. \u201cYou look at every team and you look at all the quarterbacks. If you don\u2019t have one, how are you going to compete? If you don\u2019t have a rusher, how are you going to get after the quarterback? If you don\u2019t have the corners ... how are you going to stop Davante Adams. There are weapons all across the division.\u201d\n\nWhen every team in the division locked down its franchise passer, it only made sense that the countermove was to find the player who can shut him down. It\u2019s why every team in the division either signed, traded or extended a pass rusher.\n\nThe trio of Mack, Gregory and Jones added 22.5 sacks to the division. Even perfunctory signings like defensive tackles Sebastian Joseph-Day and Austin Johnson to the Chargers, D.J. Jones to the Broncos and Bilal Nichols to the Raiders added another 10.5 sacks. That\u2019s not counting the stud pass rushers already in the division like Joey Bosa, Bradley Chubb, Chris Jones and the recently re-signed Frank Clark and Maxx Crosby.\n\nThe proliferation of defensive standouts doesn\u2019t end at the line. The Chargers recognized they needed to pair safety Derwin James with a lockdown cornerback, so they paid up for Jackson. The Raiders traded for cornerback Rock Ya-Sin as well, and the Chiefs added safety Justin Reid. Las Vegas is reportedly interested in cornerback Stephon Gilmore, too.\n\nAnd the quarterbacks? They got some new weapons. The Chargers already locked up their No. 2 receiver in Mike Williams earlier this offseason. Then the Raiders went out and acquired Adams to give Carr a true No. 1 option next to tight end Darren Waller, slot receiver Hunter Renfrow and running back Josh Jacobs.\n\nThe Chiefs added JuJu Smith-Schuster to give Mahomes a bonafide third pass-catching option. The Broncos didn\u2019t bring in anyone new, but they already secured their young offensive corps with extensions for receivers Courtland Sutton and Tim Patrick, who will continue to line up alongside third-year wideout Jerry Jeudy and second-year running back Javonte Williams."}

Kai, who has become increasingly paranoid over Speedwagon's disappearance, is shown by Ally the recording device she found two days earlier. She explains that she killed Speedwagon after learning he was a police informant that infiltrated the cult in order to avoid drug charges. Ally also relays that Winter was innocent the whole time, while simultaniously encouraging Kai to channel his rage and finish the plan in her memory. However, on the night that the killings are set to occur, Ally betrays Kai by allowing the FBI to storm the inner sanctum. She and Beverly are captured while Kai is led out, who then realizes that Ally set him up."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me one important fact from the information below?\n\nHow to save water: 10 tips for saving water around the home\nThe majority of household water use comes from toilets, washing machines, showers, baths, faucets and leaks, but what you can do to save water is fairly simple. These 10 water-saving tips will put you on the path to conserving water in your household.\n\nPut a brick in your toilet\u2019s water tank. You flush an average of 20 gallons of water a day down the toilet. If you don\u2019t have a high-efficiency toilet, try filling your tank with something that will displace some of that water, such as a brick.\n\nUse the right amount of water for each load of laundry. Typically 15-40 percent of indoor home water use comes from doing laundry. Save water by making sure to adjust the settings on your machine to the proper load size.\n\nPick your washing machine wisely. When considering top-load vs. front-load washers, front-loading washing machines generally use less water.\n\nWater plants wisely. Water your lawn or garden early in the morning or late in the evening, so the water lasts and is not immediately evaporated by the hot sun.\nInstall a low-flow showerhead. With a low-flow showerhead, you can save 15 gallons of water during a 10-minute shower.\n\nCheck for and repair leaks. An average of 10,000 gallons of water is wasted every year due to household leaks. One of the most effective ways to cut your water footprint is to repair leaky faucets and toilets.\n\nUse a dishwasher. Dishwashing accounts for less than 2 percent of indoor water use, but using a machine is actually more water efficient than hand washing, especially if you run full loads. ENERGY STAR\u00ae dishwashers save about 1,600 gallons of water over its lifetime of use.\nTurn off the water. Teach your whole household to turn off the faucet while brushing teeth or shaving. Every little bit of water conservation helps!\n\nDefrost food in the fridge. Instead of running frozen foods under hot water from the faucet, build in time to let them defrost in the refrigerator.\n\nManage outdoor water use. Don\u2019t forget about water conservation outside as well. Equip all hoses with shut-off nozzles, which can prevent hose leaks."}

{"prompt": "What does the article say about the newborn porcupine?\n\nMuch of the growth of the Smithsonian Institution comes by donation. But one part of the Smithsonian has a collection that can expand on its own. That is the National Zoo, where earlier this year, the porcupine family added a member through birth.\n\nBorn to Quillbur and Beatrix in early January was a male porcupette (as baby porcupines are called), now named Fofo, the zoo said.\n\nFofo is of the prehensile-tailed species, native to South America and able to use its tail for gripping. In Portuguese, the zoo noted, Fofo means cute.\n\nPorcupines, perhaps as much as any creature, show the variety of forms allowed to animals. Many of us may know porcupines for their sharp quills, and so view them as prickly sorts.\n\nBut a March 4 zoo report on Fofo suggested an animal\u2019s personality may not reflect its structure. Fofo, the zoo said, is calm, gentle and good-natured \u2014 almost as if his conduct is guided by character rather than quills.\n\nThe birth process of these porcupines also seems to show nature\u2019s creativity. At birth, the zoo said, the quills are soft. They harden only after exposure to air."}

LDWF biologists and managers recommend shrimp seasons based on a shrimp species\u2019 annual life cycles and growth rates, which are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. LDWF biologists continually monitor shrimp populations and environmental conditions in Louisiana\u2019s marshes, coastal lakes, and bays. At hundreds of sample locations, they tow trawls through the water, count and identify the species they catch, measure a random selection of the shrimp catch, and record the data. They also record water conductivity, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels. They then compile the data and plug it into mathematical models. These models help biologists project when the majority of the shrimp population within each the state\u2019s major estuarine basins will reach market size. The Commission uses these projections to determine when and where to open and close the shrimp fishery. Adjusting seasons in response to the conditions that influence shrimp populations helps fishermen have more productive shrimping trips."}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the following article into THREE SHORT sentences?\n\nA Cornish start-up has developed a technique using artificial intelligence to predict what the surface of the UK looks like under gloomy skies.\n\nThe satellite technology is being targeted at the agricultural sector to help farmers better manage their crops.\n\nCloud too often prevents them from seeing the ground to know where and when to sow seed or apply fertiliser.\n\nAspia Space's technology can produce a clear synthetic image of fields in all weathers.\n\nThe Penryn-based company is one of a cluster of operators hoping to benefit from the new space economy being built around Spaceport Cornwall, which is due to start launching rockets from Newquay this summer.\n\nAspia's patented algorithm relies on two types on satellite.\n\nOne of them is the European Union's workhorse Sentinel-2 spacecraft, which views the ground at so-called optical wavelengths - the type of light to which our eyes are also sensitive.\n\nIts pictures are intuitive and easy to analyse - unless the ground is smothered by cloud, which in the UK is a frequent occurrence.\n\nBut another EU satellite, Sentinel-1, uses radar to map the ground. Its microwave emission has no problem piercing cloud. Indeed, Sentinel-1 will even see the surface in darkness, at night.\n\nThe difficulty with this type of observation, however, is that it is very technical and requires real skill and expertise to interpret.\n\nSo Aspia has trained its algorithm to interpret the radar reflections and turn them into a synthetic optical image.\n\nThis means that for a farmer wanting to assess their crop performance this year, instead of getting just a handful of cloud-free Sentinel-2 pictures of their fields through the growing season, they can now have a Sentinel-2-like image every time the radar satellite comes overhead.\n\nIn the UK, this might be a couple of times a week.\n\n\"To be clear, what you're seeing is a prediction,\" explains Aspia co-founder Jim Geach, who's an astrophysicist at Hertfordshire University.\n\n\"What we do is we just mimic all of the Sentinel-2 bands (colours). And then you can use those in exactly the same way you would if you had the real imagery.\"\n\nThe algorithm has been developed with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and AeroSpace Cornwall, a research, innovation and development fund.\n\nAspia is now working with potential clients to see how the approach could work for them.\n\nGeoff Smith is an Earth observation consultant and heavy user of Sentinel-2 imagery. He's intrigued by the proposition but needs convincing that the two different types of satellite observations can be usefully linked in this way.\n\n\"Optical and shortwave infrared are related to colour, pigments, chemical composition etc, while microwaves are related to surface roughness and structure. For instance, a field of wheat will change colour as it matures ready for harvest, but its structure and roughness will remain the same,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAspia's Jim Geach says the reactions he's had so far have been very encouraging, and believes the algorithm will open up the six-year archive of cloudy Sentinel-2 imagery to all kinds of new analysis, from mapping trends in drought to tracking the extent of frost and snow cover.\n\n\"We have a way of identifying flood risk at a highly granular scale, because you can go back through the entire archive and ask: What fraction of time was a given pixel ever saturated by water? And, of course, that's a map that's going to be changing over time as the climate changes,\" he explained.\n\nAnd this is not just a technique for the UK, it can be applied anywhere in the world where the Sentinel pair of satellites are collecting data.\n\nCornwall itself is busy preparing for its maiden rocket mission this summer.\n\nThe county's spaceport, based at Newquay airport, will be an international base for entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.\n\nIt uses a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo to launch rockets out over the ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, together with the head of Spaceport Cornwall, Melissa Thorpe, \"cut turf\" on a new Centre for Space Technologies.\n\nThe centre will act as a facility to prepare satellites for flight, as well as a research and development hub for small space companies in the region.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: \"Cornwall is leading some of the most significant innovations currently taking place in the space sector. Not only can it claim the world's most capable satellite ground station, Earth observation facilities, and a dedicated horizontal launch site, but it is set to make history later this year by becoming home to the first UK satellite launch.\""}

Experts have lamented that changing the clocks has wide-ranging negative consequences, from sleep disruptions to a temporary uptick in traffic accidents.\n\nEighteen states have already moved to adopt DST year-round but cannot do so without congressional approval, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida said Tuesday.\n\nAnd now the U.S. Senate has moved to do away with the bi-annual clock change.\n\nBut 48 years ago, the U.S. tried the same thing \u2013 and public opinion of the change quickly deteriorated,\nleading lawmakers to rapidly reverse course. The U.S. is set up for a similar rude awakening if it makes daylight saving time permanent, according to David Prerau, an expert and author on DST.\n\nThe public liked the idea of avoiding the confusion and frustration of changing the clocks by an hour twice a year. But soon Americans realized what permanent daylight saving time meant: Sunrises at 8 a.m. or later in the middle of winter.

{"prompt": "Parse the following source material and tell me who was the president at the time of the event, what category was the event, where the event affected the worse - Hurricane Katrina was a large and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that caused over 1,800 fatalities and $125 billion in damage in late August 2005, especially in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. It was at the time the costliest tropical cyclone on record and is now tied with 2017's Hurricane Harvey. The storm was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States.\n\nKatrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida, strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nFlooding, caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system (levees)[3] around the city of New Orleans, precipitated most of the loss of lives.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes, were inundated for weeks.[5] The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food, shelter, or other basic necessities. The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts; federal, local, and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks. Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems,[6] though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7]\n\nThe emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Eddie Compass. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and President George W. Bush, while several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC was especially applauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.[8] Katrina was the earliest 11th named storm on record before being surpassed by Tropical Storm Kyle on August 14, 2020.[9]"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\n'We now know what he was doing': Does Van Gogh's last painting shine a light on his final days?\nA researcher in France has discovered what is now being accepted as the place Vincent van Gogh painted his final artwork, but what does that mean for the theories on his death? Nina Siegal writes\n\nOne hundred and thirty years ago, Vincent van Gogh awoke in his room at an inn in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, and went out, as he usually did, with a canvas to paint. That night, he returned to the inn with a fatal gunshot wound. He died two days later, on 29 July 1890.\n\nScholars have long speculated about the sequence of events on the day of the shooting, and now Wouter van der Veen, a researcher in France, says he has discovered a large piece of the puzzle: the precise location where Van Gogh created his final painting, Tree Roots. The finding could help to better understand how the artist spent his final day of work.\n\n\u201cWe now know what he was doing during his last day\u201d before he was shot, says Van der Veen, the scientific director of the Van Gogh Institute, a nonprofit established to preserve the artist\u2019s tiny room at the Auberge Ravoux, the inn in Auvers-sur-Oise. \u201cWe know that he spent all day painting this painting,\u201d Van der Veen notes.\n\nTree Roots was painted on the Rue Daubigny, a main road through Auvers-sur-Oise, which is about 20 miles north of Paris, Van der Veen found. The tangled, gnarled tree roots and stumps can still be seen in the slope of a hill there today, just 500 feet from the Auberge Ravoux, where Van Gogh spent the last 70 days of his life. \n\nResearchers at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam have endorsed the finding.\n\nLouis van Tilborgh, a senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum, says the finding is \u201can interpretation, but it looks like indeed it is true\u201d.\n\nVan der Veen says he was pointed towards the discovery while looking at images of Auvers from about 1905, which he had borrowed from Janine Demuriez, a 94-year-old Frenchwoman who has collected hundreds of historical postcards. One shows a cyclist on the Rue Daubigny, stopping next to a steep embankment, where tree roots are clearly visible.\n\nVan der Veen says he just happened to have the postcard on his screen at home in Strasbourg, France, during lockdown when something clicked in his mind: The postcard was reminiscent of Tree Roots. He pulled up a digital version of the painting and compared them side by side.\n\nThe postcard is \u201cnot a secret hidden document that nobody can find\u201d, Van der Veen says. \u201cA lot of people have already seen it, and recognise the subject, the motif of tree roots. It was hidden in plain sight.\u201d\n\nBecause he was unable to travel from Strasbourg himself, Van der Veen called Dominique-Charles Janssens, the owner of the Van Gogh Institute who was in Auvers, and asked him to take a look at the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say 45 to 50 per cent is still there,\u201d Janssens says, referring to the entanglement of roots. \u201cThey cut some of the trees down, and it was covered with ivy, but we took some of that down.\u201d\n\nVan Gogh would have walked along the Rue Daubigny to get to the town\u2019s church, which he painted for The Church at Auvers in June 1890, and to make his way to the sprawling wheat fields just outside of town, where he painted Wheatfield With Crows in July, Van der Veen says.\n\nThere has long been debate about which painting was Van Gogh\u2019s last work, because he tended not to date his paintings. Many people believe it was Wheatfield With Crows, because Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1956 biopic Lust for Life depicts Van Gogh, played by Kirk Douglas, painting that work as he goes mad, just before killing himself.\n\nAndries Bonger, who wrote down some of the events surrounding Vincent\u2019s death and was the brother-in-law of Theo van Gogh, Vincent\u2019s brother, noted in a letter, \u201cThe morning before his death, he had painted a forest scene, full of sun and life.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the Van Gogh Museum published a paper by Van Tilborgh and Bert Maes arguing that the letter referred to Tree Roots, an unfinished painting in the museum\u2019s collection. That claim has now largely been accepted by scholars.\n\nBecause of the way light is depicted on the roots, Van der Veen says he believes that Van Gogh was looking at his subject matter at the end of the afternoon, about 5pm or 6pm. He says he thinks this means that Van Gogh probably spent the entire day painting.\n\nVan der Veen adds that the new evidence challenged a theory put forward in 2011 by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith in their biography, Van Gogh: The Life. They argued that Van Gogh did not die by suicide, but may have gotten drunk and argued with two young boys, who then accidentally killed him, not far from the Auberge Ravoux. Van der Veen\u2019s research on Tree Roots is published in a book in France, and will also be available in English in digital form.\n\n\u201cNow that we know he was painting all day, there was even less time for that to happen,\u201d Van der Veen says.\n\nNaifeh responds that it would be impossible to time-stamp a painting based on the angle of the light. \u201cIt\u2019s not a photograph; it\u2019s a painting,\u201d he says. \u201cVan Gogh painted somewhat abstractly, and he was always introducing a lot of painterly inventions,\u201d he adds, so it would be hard to tell if he was painting light he saw with his own eyes or just creating it on the canvas.\n\nNaifeh says the discovery could even support his murder theory. \u201cThe fact that he went out and painted all day, not just an average painting but a very important painting, indicates that he may not have been depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was otherwise a productive normal day, and that runs counterintuitive to the idea that he might then go and kill himself.\u201d\n\nVan der Veen agrees on one point. \u201cIt confirms everything that most witnesses at this time say, that his behaviour was perfectly normal in the last days,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no sign that he was having a crisis.\u201d\n\nHowever, Van der Veen maintains that van Gogh killed himself, which is also the official position of the Van Gogh Museum.\n\nVan Gogh had also made a drawing of tree roots when he lived in The Hague in 1882. He described the artwork to his brother, Theo, in a letter.\n\nHe wrote that he wanted the tree to \u201cexpress something of life\u2019s struggle\u201d, seeing it as, \u201cFrantically and fervently rooting itself, as it were, in the earth, and yet being half torn up by the storm.\u201d\n\nVan der Veen says that Tree Roots expressed something similar.\n\n\u201cEnding his life with this painting makes so much sense,\u201d he says. \u201cThe painting illustrates the struggle of life, and a struggle with death. That\u2019s what he leaves behind. It is a farewell note in colours.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "What paradox is this Wikipedia article referring to?\n\nIt is often said that we fail to attain pleasures if we deliberately seek them. This has been described variously, by many:\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:\nBut I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.[2]\n\nViktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning:\nHappiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\n\nThe more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.[3]\n\nPhilosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901):\nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.\nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power increases\u2014that a resistance is overcome.[4]\n\n[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)[5]\n\nPsychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):\nNietzsche's \"will to power\" and \"will to seem\" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of F\u00e9r\u00e9 and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.[6]\n\nPoet and satirist Edward Young:\nThe love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,\nReigns more or less supreme in every heart;\nThe Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;\nThe modest shun it, but to make it sure![7]\n\nPolitician William Bennett:\nHappiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.[8][9]\n\nNovelist Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa:\nHappiness is found only in little moments of inattention."}

{"prompt": "Parse the following source material and tell me who was the president at the time of the event, what category was the event, where the event affected the worse - Hurricane Katrina was a large and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that caused over 1,800 fatalities and $125 billion in damage in late August 2005, especially in the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. It was at the time the costliest tropical cyclone on record and is now tied with 2017's Hurricane Harvey. The storm was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States.\n\nKatrina originated on August 23, 2005, as a tropical depression from the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten. Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm as it headed generally westward toward Florida, strengthening into a hurricane two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach on August 25. After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and began to rapidly intensify. The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to Category 3 strength at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nFlooding, caused largely as a result of fatal engineering flaws in the flood protection system (levees)[3] around the city of New Orleans, precipitated most of the loss of lives.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large tracts of neighboring parishes, were inundated for weeks.[5] The flooding also destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who had not evacuated the city prior to landfall stranded with little access to food, shelter, or other basic necessities. The scale of the disaster in New Orleans provoked massive national and international response efforts; federal, local, and private rescue operations evacuated displaced persons out of the city over the following weeks. Multiple investigations in the aftermath of the storm concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems,[6] though federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7]\n\nThe emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, resulting in the resignations of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) Superintendent Eddie Compass. Many other government officials were criticized for their responses, especially New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and President George W. Bush, while several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions. The NHC was especially applauded for providing accurate forecasts well in advance.[8] Katrina was the earliest 11th named storm on record before being surpassed by Tropical Storm Kyle on August 14, 2020.[9]"}

His first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician \u201canalyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal\u201d.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as \u201cmysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition\u201d.\n\nCombined with nearly 150 \u201ccarefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs\u201d, the collection \u201cresembles an epic poem\u201d, said S&S.\n\nJonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: \u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.\u201d\n\nDylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016. His latest album, 2020\u2019s Rough and Rowdy Ways, received mass critical acclaim and was placed highly in many publications\u2019 end-of-year lists.\n\nIn January, he sold his entire recorded catalogue to Sony Music Entertainment, following the sale in 2020 of his publishing catalogue to Universal Music.\n\nDylan is currently fighting a lawsuit that alleges he groomed and sexually abused a woman, referred to as JC, when she was 12 years old. His legal team have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit \u201ca brazen shakedown ... false, malicious, reckless and defamatory\u201d.\n\nThe Philosophy of Modern Song is published on 8 November , with an accompanying audiobook partially narrated by Dylan."}

Lockdowns and an international border closure have helped to keep infection and death numbers very low.\n\nBut the duration of many restrictions - including a minimum 10-day isolation and a vaccine mandate - has fuelled growing resentment in the community.\n\nPublic polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Jacinda Ardern's government, and there has been an increase in protest activity in recent months."}

{"prompt": "What is being discussed in this article? Can you summarize it for me in 5 sentences?\n\nAfter two years of living with Covid-19, travelers are making big vacation plans again.\n\nBut not every type of trip may be available this year, travel professionals said.\n\nThat\u2019s because many people postponed more ambitious vacations during the pandemic \u2014 in some cases two years in a row \u2014 leaving little room for new bookings this year.\n\nNearly half of those who had vacations canceled in 2020 and 2021 plan to take them this year, according to a survey by travel insurance firm Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection. Only 5.5% are pushing these plans to next year, and less than 4% plan to cancel altogether, according to the survey of more than 1,500 travelers.\n\nIn addition, people are taking longer trips and booking them further in advance. Some fall and winter holidays are already beginning to sell out, said Lee Thompson, co-founder of adventure travel company, Flash Pack.\n\nBut some trips may be fully booked long before then, like these four types of vacations that travel insiders say are filling fast for the summer.\n\nAfrican safaris\nBooking an African safari 12 to 18 months in advance could be the new norm, said Shannon Kircher, founder of the U.S.-based boutique travel firm Compass & Vine.\n\nMany travelers dream about going on a safari, but don\u2019t pull the trigger because of the amount of planning and money that goes into it, said Kircher.\n\nHowever, the pandemic has \u201cchallenged our ideas of pushing off meaningful trips,\u201d she said. Plus, more people have the time and money to travel now, because of canceled trips from the past two years, she said.\n\nFor travelers easing back into the idea of international travel during the pandemic, the privacy and open-air nature of safaris are appealing, she said.\n\n\u201cSafaris are inherently socially distanced \u2014 you\u2019re around more animals than humans generally,\u201d she said.\n\nTravelers are choosing to visit East Africa from June through October as the period coincides with the great wildebeest migration, Kircher said, with many extending their trip to squeeze in a gorilla trekking experience or a post-safari beach escape.\n\nHawaii vacation home rentals\nMultiple locations in Hawaii are at risk of being without vacancies this summer, said Zander Buteux of home rental company VacationRenter.\n\n\u201cIf you wait until June to book for June travel, you will have slim pickings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially true for the key cities on each island such as Honolulu, Lahaina and Kihei.\u201d\n\nTwo areas that still have a good amount of availability are O\u2019ahu and Hanalei, said Buteux, though he doesn\u2019t expect things to stay this way.\n\nTravel to Hawaii has been on the rise for the past eight months, said Buteux. Business is expected to pick up even more \u2014 along with prices \u2014 once the state lifts many of its pandemic travel restrictions this month, he said. Starting March 26, visitors from the continental United States will no longer be required to show their Covid-19 vaccination status or a negative pre-travel Covid-19 test to enter.\n\nSummer isn\u2019t the only time of year that\u2019s being booked up fast, said Phil Jones, CEO of the luxury vacation home Pure Kauai. Easter and Christmas periods are also filling up, he said.  \n\nLike Buteux, he said: Once \u201cquarantine restrictions have been lifted, we predict a surge in bookings.\u201d\n\nLuxury dude ranches\nAmericans who are still hesitant about international travel are booking luxurious off-the-grid vacation spots in the country, said Kircher.\n\nSome well-known ranches are booked more than a year in advance, she said.\n\nThe Ranch at Rock Creek in Montana is mostly booked until February 2023, and almost all weekend slots at Wyoming\u2019s Brush Creek Ranch are full, according to their online reservation systems.\n\n\u201cFor most people, the privacy and disconnected nature of dude ranches are appealing,\u201d Kircher said. Activities such as horseback riding, fly fishing and white water rafting are outdoors and naturally socially distanced.\n\nPlus, visitors also get many of their needs taken care of as \u201cmost of the high-end lodges are really all-inclusive, meaning food, drinks, and luxury amenities are included,\u201d she said.\n\nPrivate yacht charters\nBooking last-minute summer yacht charters is a thing of the past, said Tim Geisler, founder of Grenada-based sailing company, Nautilus Sailing.\n\nMany destinations, especially in the Mediterranean, are selling out well ahead of time, he said.\n\nGreece, Spain and the French island of Corsica are the most popular charter destinations in the Mediterranean now, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are noticing that things are starting to return to almost pre-pandemic levels,\u201d said Geisler, adding that \u201c80% of our charters are already booked out in Spain.\u201d\n\nSummer yachting trips to the Mediterranean are popular among Americans because they tend to avoid the Caribbean during this time, as it coincides with the area\u2019s hurricane season, he said.\n\nThe company is seeing an increase in bookings and inquiries from travelers who want to book trips nine to 12 months ahead of time, which limits inventory down the line, he said.\n\n\u201cThe later you make a reservation, the less choice you will have when it comes to yacht size, configuration and location, therefore it\u2019s best to book [at least] six months in advance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company recently started operating in Croatia, said Geisler, adding that there is yacht availability there for the summer, but likely not for long.\n\nThe global yacht charter market, which was valued at $16.9 billion in 2021, is projected to reach $26.5 billion by 2027, with Europe being the top go-to destination in the summer months, according to the market research firm Mordor Intelligence."}

{"prompt": "What vegetables does this article say are good for roasting?\n\nWhen it comes to which vegetables taste best when roasted in the oven, it can be hard to choose the wrong one! Carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, any variety of squash, pumpkin, potatoes, onions, parsnips and beets are some great options.\n\nThe only veggies that don't roast well? If you're thinking about roasting delicate salad greens, like baby spinach or arugula, don't.\n\nMost veggies roast up well simply seasoned with just some olive oil, salt and pepper. You can always spruce up your veggies with a little bacon fat, just like Al Roker.\n\nAlways make sure the oven is fully preheated before roasting: About 375-400 F for root vegetables, and 400-425 F for veggies that have more water. If the oven is the wrong temperature, your cooking time might not yield the desired result.\n\nPreheat your tray in the oven while you prepare your vegetables. This way, when they make contact with the tray, they instantly begin to sizzle and roast. You also may not want to use parchment paper when roasting my vegetables because it limits the browning you get on the surface of the vegetables (but, of course, if you don't want to clean the baking sheet, by all means, use it).\n\nTo make sure your vegetables are evenly coated with oil and seasoning, toss everything together in a bowl before laying them out on the tray. Don't overcrowd the veggies or the hot air won't circulate and the veggies will steam instead of roast.\n\nAbout every 10 minutes or so, rotate the tray in the oven so all the vegetables are being evenly roasted. You should  also stir them around a bit using a spatula to make sure they\u2019re crisping evenly and not sticking to the tray. Some ovens have hot spots where one side cooks more than the others, which is why its always good to rotate your trays while roasting.\n\nIf you try to flip your veggies and they're sticking to the pan, it means they're not ready to flipped. Have patience and the veggies will respect you."}

{"prompt": "Forty years ago, Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash while on tour with Ozzy Osbourne in Florida. The classically trained metal guitarist was only 25 years old when he died, and had only come onto the scene recently as the guitarist and co-songwriter for Osbourne's first two solo albums. Yet he left behind an incredible, indelible legacy thanks to his lightning-speed, virtuosic soloing, which helped define the \u201880s metal sound and influenced guitarists for decades to come. In fact, just last year, Rhoads was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRhoads\u2019s pal Rudy Sarzo, who played with the legend in the late-\u201870s, pre-fame Quiet Riot lineup and was recruited by Rhoads to play bass for Osbourne in 1981 \u2014 and was present at the crash and nearly boarded the plane that day \u2014 has had a major part in keeping his late bandmate\u2019s legacy alive for decades. He even wrote a book, Off the Rails: Aboard the Crazy Train in the Blizzard of Ozz about his bond with the guitar god.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I wrote the book,\u201d Sarzo tells Yahoo Entertainment. \u201cI wrote it because I have to go back. Sometimes I go back as a spectator, and that way, I avoid feeling the pain again. I go back and I actually see myself in the place at the moment, but I'm disconnected from it, because it\u2019s like I'm watching myself go through this. But for this [Yahoo interview], I had to go in as myself, rather than as a witness.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this news article for me?\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration is set to extend the federal public transportation mask mandate for another 30 days, an administration official told CNN, pointing to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mandate is one of the last remaining broad requirements that Americans wear masks in public places. It applies to mass transportation including planes, trains, buses and hubs like airports.\n\nThe official\u2019s comments came after CNN reported that federal officials began notifying stakeholders in the airline industry of the upcoming announcement. Three sources, including two industry officials and a government official, described the conversations to CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe requirement, which now extends to April 18, was previously set to expire a week from Friday, and the policy will be reviewed over the next month, the official said.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, CDC will work with government agencies to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis revised framework will be based on the Covid-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. We will communicate any updates publicly if and/or when they change.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that means the CDC may ultimately allow the mandate to lift before the 30-day period is up if transmission rates of the virus nationwide drop to low enough levels.\n\nThe federal announcement comes as many state and local mask mandates have been dropped or are set to be rescinded.\n\nIn the skies, requiring masks has proven to be a divisive issue. Flight crew unions applauded the measure for protecting flight attendants who can not avoid close contact with scores of passengers.\n\nBut some passengers refused, leading to more than 4,800 reports to the Federal Aviation Administration of passengers who turned disruptive or violent while flouting the mask rule. The agency adopted a zero-tolerance approach to in-flight outbursts, which surged during the pandemic.\n\nSome in the airline industry have described a concern about lifting the mandate too soon, ahead of another wave of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t want is to lift the mandate and have to reimpose it,\u201d one of the sources told CNN."}

Glaucoma is increased pressure on your cat's eye caused by a failure of the eye's drainage system. The increased pressure can then lead to the destruction of the cat's retina and optic disk, where the optic nerve enters the eye.\n\nWhat causes glaucoma in cats?\nPrimary glaucoma is typically caused by a problem in how the eye has developed and is very rare in cats although sometimes seen in certain breeds including Siamese, Persian, and Burmese cats. This form of glaucoma usually begins in one eye, but it eventually involves both eyes and leads to complete blindness.\n\nSecondary glaucoma in cats is more common and typically due to uveitis, (which is inflammation inside the eye), or advanced cataracts, tumors, or retinal detachment.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of glaucoma in cats?\nIn spite of the fact that this condition is very painful, cats tend to be very good at hiding symptoms of glaucoma. Subtle signs of pain or illness include hiding, becoming less affectionate than normal and reduced grooming. Other signs of glaucoma in cats can include partially closed eye, pawing at eyes, watery discharge, obvious swelling or bulging of the eyeball, bloodshot eye, cloudiness of eye, dilated pupil or blindness.\n\nHow is glaucoma in cats diagnosed?\nFirst your vet will look for common symptoms of the condition, then to confirm a diagnosis of glaucoma your veterinary ophthamologist will measure the pressures of your cat's eyes, using a special piece of equipment called a Tonopen. \n\nCan glaucoma in cats be cured?\nSadly, cats are able to hide signs of pain very well, and the symptoms of glaucoma are often not picked up until the disease has progressed. By the time many cats see a vet they will have lost their eyesight permanently, and treatment will be focused on pain relief.\n\nThat said, when diagnosed early treatment may include a combination of surgery and medications to reduce eye pressures, preserve vision, and manage pain.\n\nEye Drops & Medications to Treat Glaucoma in Cats\nA number of different eye drops and pills are available to help decrease fluid production or increase fluid drainage from the eye. However they are not typically effective for controlling glaucoma in long term. These treatments are most often used to help prevent or delay the onset of glaucoma in the remaining eye, and as temporary treatment until surgery can be performed in the affected eye.\n\nSurgery to Treat Glaucoma in Cats\nWhile surgical treatments are available for glaucoma in cats, the type of surgery will depend on whether your cat still has the potential for vision.\n\nFor cat's with vision, a veterinary ophthamologist may be able to reduce the eye's pressure by performing a cycloablation procedure and a drainage implant procedure.\n\nIn cat's that have already lost their vision, your veterinary specialist may recommend the removal of eye in order to relieve the pain caused by glaucoma."}

{"prompt": "Can you give me a short summary about what this article says about Daylight Savings Time?\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.\n\nThe Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, still must pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. The White House has not said whether Biden supports it.\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said after input from airlines and broadcasters that supporters agreed that the change would not take place until November 2023.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America but it is one of those issues that there is a lot of agreement. ... If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore,\" Rubio added. \"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nAbout 30 states since 2015 have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue this month. Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said that \"the loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found that 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nSupporters argue it could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\nThe use of daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was adopted in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time."}

{"prompt": "What does this article say about the Deltacron variant?\n\nIn many countries, as restrictions lift and freedoms are restored, there\u2019s a general feeling that the pandemic is over. There is, however, still the significant concern that a dangerous new variant could emerge.\n\nThis happened when omicron arrived, but we got lucky with that one. Omicron turned out to be more transmissible, but mercifully it hasn\u2019t caused an increase in severe disease in most countries where it is dominant.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t guaranteed. Variants crop up randomly, and new ones have the potential to be more dangerous than previous ones. Another has just arrived, and is currently going by the name deltacron. It is \u2013 as you can probably guess \u2013 a hybrid of delta and omicron, the two variants dominant most recently.\n\nDeltacron\u2019s story begins in mid-February, when scientists at the Institut Pasteur in Paris uploaded a genetic sequence of the coronavirus that looked very different from previous sequences. The virus sample had come from an elderly man in northern France and looked odd. Most of its genetic sequence was the same as delta\u2019s, which was dominant worldwide up until late last year, but the part of the sequence that encodes the virus\u2019s spike protein \u2013 a key part of its external structure, which it uses to get inside cells in the body \u2013 came from omicron.\n\nBy March, three further hybrid genetic sequences had been reported, this time in the US. There are now over 60 logged, across France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the US and the UK.\n\nThere may, however, be different deltacrons. Scientists at the Institut Pasteur have said the deltacron sequences reported in the UK and US have certain differences from those found in other countries. They\u2019ve said that it might be necessary to add a number to these different forms of deltacron, to indicate which is which.\n\nHow these hybrids formed\nIt\u2019s not unusual for viruses to mix and match parts of themselves if two different viruses infect one cell. This is called \u201crecombination\u201d, as one virus combines parts of its genetic sequence with parts from another related virus as it assembles copies of itself. It appears to happen at random during viral replication.\n\nHowever, when there\u2019s a transfer of power from one viral variant to another \u2013 with one variant becoming less common and another more so, meaning both are circulating in the population and there\u2019s a chance for them to simultaneously infect people \u2013 the chance of recombination happening increases. This will have been the situation as omicron emerged to displace delta as the most dominant form worldwide.\n\nRecombination usually creates a new virus that isn\u2019t viable, as the mixing of different genes can interfere with the virus\u2019s ability to make the proteins it needs to survive. But sometimes one does survive, and that appears to be what\u2019s happened with deltacron.\n\nIndeed, as the deltacron hybrids found in the US/UK appear to be different from those found in mainland Europe, it\u2019s possible that this has happened multiple times separately.\n\nA chip off the old block?\nAt the moment it\u2019s hard to say in what ways deltacron will resemble its parents. Delta and omicron are quite different viruses. They differ in how they infect cells and how they evade immunity. We still don\u2019t know enough about deltacron to be able to tell how different it\u2019s going to be to either.\n\nBecause it\u2019s been found in multiple nearby countries, it\u2019s likely that deltacron can spread. However, omicron itself is continuing to spread widely in Europe, so it\u2019s still the variant we need to be watching carefully right now."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article for me in 3 paragraphs or less?\n\nGov. Spencer Cox announced Friday Utah is on track to start treating COVID-19 like the flu or other seasonal respiratory diseases by March 31, stopping just short of declaring the pandemic is over in the state after more than two years.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear that this is not the end of COVID,\u201d the governor said during a news conference at the state Capitol in Salt Lake City outlining the Utah Department of Health\u2019s plans to discontinue testing for all but the most vulnerable Utahns as well as daily reports on the spread of the virus.\n\nThe changes don\u2019t mean that Utah is \u201cspiking the football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the state, we are not packing up and heading home. We will continue to see cases and outbreaks and hospitalizations and, unfortunately, deaths. But it does mean we are adapting to how we respond to these things. There is still work to be done,\u201d Cox said.\n\nOver the next six weeks, he said the virus testing and treatment now provided by the state health department will shift to private health care systems. COVID-19 vaccinations and monitoring will continue to be handled by the public health agency, and testing and other supplies will be stockpiled in case of a future outbreak.\nIt\u2019s a transition from \u201can emergency posture and into a manageable risk model,\u201d where it\u2019s up to Utahns to decide for themselves whether they need to wear a mask, social distance or get vaccinated, the governor said, suggesting that for some at least, it\u2019s time to be more relaxed.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole bunch of people who are unvaccinated and unboosted and at high risk who should take this disease much more seriously. There are also a whole bunch of people in our state who are vaccinated and boosted and young and at low risk who could stand to take this disease a lot less seriously,\u201d Cox said.\n\nBoth Intermountain Healthcare, the region\u2019s largest health care provider, and University of Utah Health, the only academic health care system in the mountain west, issued statements after the governor\u2019s announcement stressing the need for Utahns to keep taking precautions against the virus.\n\n\u201cIntermountain Healthcare strongly encourages Utahns to continue to employ good preventive practices, including masking in public, avoiding large gatherings, and getting vaccinated or boosted to combat the transmission and severe health impacts of COVID,\u201d Intermountain Healthcare spokesman Jess Gomez said.\n\nU. Health spokeswoman Kathy Wilets said, \u201cThough cases are declining, COVID-19 continues to strain our resources as a hospital system. We ask the public to continue to mask, vaccinate, and practice social distancing as we work vigilantly to provide care to our community.\u201d\nLt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said the administration will continue to encourage Utahns to get vaccinated against COVID-19, including children as young as 6 months old once they become eligible for the shots. Federal authorities have delayed the approval process until a study of a third dose is completed, likely in April.\n\n\u201cVaccines have saved a lot of lives, and they\u2019ve prevented so much spread,\u201d Henderson said, despite breakthrough cases like her recent second bout with COVID-19 that kept her home for weeks. Thanks to being vaccinated, she did not require hospitalization or ongoing supplemental oxygen this time, unlike her first case in 2020.\n\nVaccinations prevent severe illness, the lieutenant governor said, but Utah \u201chas a long way to go\u201d when it comes to booster shots. Currently, less than 61% of all Utahns are fully vaccinated, meaning it\u2019s been two weeks or more since their final, initial dose, and just over 26% have also gotten a booster shot.\nThe science supports the move, Cox said, citing reliance on testing wastewater for the virus and other measures after he told most Utahns to skip testing if they show symptoms. Utah\u2019s case counts have dropped since a January surge fueled by the omicron variant, along with hospitalizations, but deaths remain high.\n\nFriday, the state health department reported 15 additional deaths from COVID-19, including two deaths that occurred before Jan. 18, bringing Utah\u2019s death toll from the virus to 4,359. There were also 999 new cases reported, and 459 people are currently hospitalized in Utah with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe know where this is going. We know what the trends are. And if it doesn\u2019t, we have the ability to adjust. This idea that we have to get stuck in some crazy situation forever is very, very unscientific,\u201d the Republican leader said, noting other states, including those led by Democrats, are taking similar actions.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at the news media, saying he is \u201cvery disappointed in the media members that continue to perpetuate that instead of understanding. We\u2019ve seen a huge change in the national media and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because blue governors are sounding like red governors now.\u201d\nUtahns are ready for what would be the endemic phase of COVID-19, he said. Unlike during a pandemic, when exponential spread of a disease encompasses the globe, a disease is considered endemic when outbreaks are more limited, even though hospitalizations and deaths continue.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re moving on to this new phase of the pandemic response, as we\u2019re moving away from a pandemic response, most Americans, most Utahns, are ready to be done with this,\u201d the governor said, urging Utahns to be respectful of those who continue to wear masks and take other precautions against the virus.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s \u201ca false question\u201d to ask about the impact of the new phase on the immunocompromised who depend on others to take precautions around them because they are more vulnerable to infection, along with others, including the elderly and children under 5 who cannot yet get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely false that if you\u2019re immunocompromised, you can\u2019t protect yourself from COVID-19, and that we have to have every single person in the world protect you from COVID-19. That was true a year ago. That is not true today,\u201d the governor said, given booster shots and new treatments.\n\nTwo of his siblings are \u201cseverely immunocompromised\u201d and one has regularly worn N95 masks for many years, Cox said, telling Utahns because \u201cwe care deeply about our immunocompromised individuals,\u201d they should not mock someone for wearing a mask.\n\n\u201cGive them your love and support,\u201d because it\u2019s very possible they\u2019re going through cancer treatment. It\u2019s very possible they live with someone who is severely immunocompromised. That\u2019s why we have to be kind and we have to be respectful of the choices people make,\u201d the governor said."}

{"prompt": "Can you make this summary of the Japanese horror film \"Ring\" more concise? Try summarizing it in two paragraphs or less.\n\nDuring a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a videotape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. Presently, the phone rings, but it turns out to merely be Tomoko's mother. After Masami goes to the toilet, Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is later killed by an unseen presence.\n\nTomoko\u2019s aunt, journalist Reiko Asakawa, investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko\u2019s funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as hers. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked videotape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.\n\nTaking the threat of death seriously, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ry\u016bji Takayama. Ry\u016bji watches the tape despite Reiko\u2019s concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an \u014cshima dialect. Before departing to Oshima for further investigation, Reiko catches her and Ry\u016bji\u2019s six-year-old son Y\u014dichi watching the tape after being told to do so by \u2018Tomoko\u2019. In \u014cshima, Reiko and Ry\u016bji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by ESP researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko\u2019s brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko\u2019s young daughter Sadako psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko\u2019s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ry\u016bji never received a phone call after watching the tape because he didn't watch it at the cabin in Izu. The pair rush there to investigate, arriving there in the afternoon.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji find a well sealed in the cabin's crawlspace, which they deduce is the same well from the videotape's ending. Through another vision, they learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into the well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape 'recorded' the rage she had projected through nensha. After draining the water, they find Sadako\u2019s remains and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.\n\nThe next day, Ry\u016bji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the videotape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ry\u016bji at the time, hears his last minutes over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ry\u016bji did not. Desperate to save Y\u014dichi, Reiko drives to her father\u2019s home with the tape and asks him to do her \"a favour\"."}

Russian forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv.\n\nBiden said the United States was offering an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones and anti-armour systems.\n\n\"More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,\" he said.\n\nBiden later condemned Putin: \"He is a war criminal,\" he told reporters.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was \"unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric\", according to Tass news agency.\n\nAt the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems as the West bolsters his government, which is still holding out hope that talks with Russia can find a solution.\n\nZelenskiy said negotiations were becoming \"more realistic\" and Russia's foreign minister said proposals under discussion were \"close to an agreement.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv.

An ancient Japanese 'killing stone' which is said to contain an evil demon that will kill anyone who comes into contact with it has split in two, sending superstitious believers into a state of panic.\n\nThe stone is located in the mountainous region of Tochigi, north of Tokyo, where visitors were given a shock over the weekend when they found it separated into two roughly similar sized parts, reports the Guardian. \n\nAccording to mythology, the famous piece of volcanic rock, called the Sessho-seki, contains the transformed corpse of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman whose true identity was said to have been an evil nine-tailed fox.\n\n\nLegend has it Tamamo-no-Mae was part of a plot to kill Emperor Toba who ruled Japan from 1107 to 1123.\n\nThe spirit was then said to have been embedded into the stone where it would kill anyone who came into contact with it.  It has been said that the rock was destroyed many years ago and a Buddhist monk exorcised the spirit from it before scattering it across Japan.\n\nHowever, many Japanese people said it was always located on the slopes of Mount Nasu and that its evil spirit may have been resurrected, releasing a poisonous gas, after it was found split in two by tourists over the weekend. \n\n'I feel like I\u2019ve seen something that shouldn\u2019t be seen', said one tourist who tweeted about the discovery on Saturday.\n\nAnother feared the release of an evil demon was just the latest horror of 2022, while one user joked that the spirit would want to spend another millennium stuck inside the rock after looking at the current state of the world. \n\nLocal media reported that the stone is likely to have split in half after rainwater seeped into cracks which first appeared several years ago, causing it to break. Masaharu Sugawara, who leads a local volunteer guide group, told Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun the split was a 'shame' because it was a popular tourist attraction for the area.\n\nHowever, he agreed that rainwater was the likely cause of the split.\n\nThe Shimotsuke Shimbun newspaper reported that local and national government officials will decide what happens to the stone now, with one official saying he would like it returned to its original form. \""}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this Wikipedia article section:\nHuman history\nThe area which now is Sequoia National Park was first home to \"Monachee\" (Western Mono) Native Americans, who resided mainly in the Kaweah River drainage in the Foothills region of the park, though evidence of seasonal habitation exists as high as the Giant Forest. In the summertime, Native Americans would travel over the high mountain passes to trade with tribes to the East. To this day, pictographs can be found at several sites within the park, notably at Hospital Rock and Potwisha, as well as bedrock mortars used to process acorns, a staple food for the Monachee people.\n\n\nTharp's Log, a cabin formed out of a hollowed-out giant sequoia log\nBy the time the first European settlers arrived in the area, smallpox had already spread to the region, decimating Native American populations. The first European settler to homestead in the area was Hale Tharp, who famously built a home out of a hollowed-out fallen giant sequoia log in the Giant Forest next to Log Meadow. Tharp allowed his cattle to graze the meadow, but at the same time had a respect for the grandeur of the forest and led early battles against logging in the area. From time to time, Tharp received visits from John Muir, who would stay at Tharp's log cabin. Tharp's Log can still be visited today in its original location in the Giant Forest.\n\nHowever, Tharp's attempts to conserve the giant sequoias were at first met with only limited success. In the 1880s, white settlers seeking to create a utopian society founded the Kaweah Colony, which sought economic success in trading Sequoia timber. However, Giant Sequoia trees, unlike their coast redwood relatives, were later discovered to splinter easily and therefore were ill-suited to timber harvesting, though thousands of trees were felled before logging operations finally ceased. The National Park Service incorporated the Giant Forest into Sequoia National Park in 1890, the year of its founding, promptly ceasing all logging operations in the Giant Forest.\n\nAnother consequence of the Giant Forest becoming Sequoia National Park was the shift in park employment. Prior to the incorporation by the National Park Service, the park was managed by US army troops of the 24th Regiment of Infantry and the 9th Regiment of Calvary, better known as the Buffalo Soldiers. [15] These troops, founded in 1866, were African-American men from the South. The Buffalo Soldiers completed park infrastructure projects as well as park management duties, those of the modern-day park ranger.\n\nThe park has expanded several times over the decades to its present size; one of the most significant expansions took place in 1926 and was advocated for by Susan Thew Parks.[16] One of the most recent expansions occurred in 1978, when grassroots efforts, spearheaded by the Sierra Club, fought off attempts by the Walt Disney Corporation to purchase a high-alpine former mining site south of the park for use as a ski resort. This site known as Mineral King was annexed to the park. Its name dates back to early 1873 when the miners in the area formed the Mineral King Mining District.[17] Mineral King is the highest-elevation developed site within the park and a popular destination for backpackers."}

{"prompt": "I'm thinking of teaching English in Korea. I have an Associates degree in English and can speak fluent Korean. Do I qualify to teach abroad according to this site? \"Qualifications to teach in South Korea\nThe easiest answer to most qualification questions about teaching English in South Korea is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Depending on the city, the age of students, and type of school you want to work at, the qualifications differ greatly. However, there are some boxes you should check off across the board.\n\nREQUIRED:\nBe a native English speaker from an approved country -- To teach English on an E-2 visa (assuming you don\u2019t qualify for an F-series visa), you must be a native English speaker from a recognized English-speaking nation such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, or Australia.\nBachelor\u2019s degree -- To legally teach English in South Korea, you must have a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited university. The degree major does not matter.\nClear criminal record check -- In Korea, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a job if you have any charges or convictions because a clean national-level criminal record check is required to receive an E-2 teaching visa. DUI\u2019s and misdemeanors, too, will disqualify you, but don\u2019t worry about traffic violations.\nSOMETIMES REQUIRED:\nTeaching certification -- While not all English teaching jobs in Korea require a teaching certificate, most do. A TEFL, TESOL, or CELTA certificate with 100 or more course hours are all equally acceptable. Many private academy jobs don\u2019t care where the accreditation is from or whether it\u2019s done online, but certain public school jobs may require you to have a certain number of \u201clive hours\u201d within a physical classroom.\nNICE-TO-HAVE'S:\nMaster's degree in relevant field -- While not necessary, if you have a master\u2019s degree in Education, TESOL, Linguistics, or a related field, you may qualify for high-paying university jobs.\nSome Korean skills -- I didn\u2019t start learning Korean until I was on the plane to Seoul. But, knowing some Korean before you arrive, especially if you aren't going through EPIK, will make your life abroad dramatically easier. Even just learning to sound out hangul letters will help. Additionally, many schools will ask you to speak only English in the classroom. But, sometimes young children will not respond to English commands (such as, \u201cSit down, please.\u201d) Knowing some Korean can make class time go more smoothly.\""}

{"prompt": "What country are investors looking at getting into - LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - While the West's big investors have ditched Russia in recent weeks, one small group of armchair investors sees a bargain and is shrugging off any ethical qualms.\n\nAt a time when many in Britain are pouring cash into charities to support relief efforts in Ukraine after its invasion by Russia, others are looking to profit and offering tips to \"buy the dip\" on social media.\n\n\"For me it is a one (sic) in a lifetime chance to buy,\" said an investor about stock in Russia-focused steel and mining group Evraz on the Reddit website on March 4.\n\nJust six days later, Evraz's London-listed shares were suspended after its biggest shareholder Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, meaning any investor who took a punt on the stock had that money frozen.\n\nDespite the risks, Russia-focused investments have proved popular with retail investors even as the war has taken a heavy human toll.\n\nRussia - which calls its actions a \"special operation\" - fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands of refugees are sheltering far from Ukraine's battlefields. read more\n\nMajor investors have called Russia \"uninvestable\", but DIY investors - many of whom took up stock-picking during the \"stonks\" trading frenzy in the pandemic - have been undeterred. read more\n\nLondon-listed stocks of Russia-focused companies - including Abramovich's Evraz and gold and silver producer Polymetal (POLYP.L) - have recently leapt into the most-bought stocks tables at several of Britain's largest investment platforms, according to a review of their websites by Reuters.\n\nEvraz stock plummeted 67% prior to its suspension, and Polymetal is down more than 85% since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24.\n\n\"It's playing with fire and seems mad to me, but some people want to take aggressive bets. And that will never change,\" said Holly Mackay, founder and chief executive of personal finance website Boring Money.\n\nMarkets regulator the Financial Conduct Authority told Reuters it was monitoring the situation.\n\n\"Investors should take care when investing in companies that may be impacted by the Russian invasion,\" the regulator said.\n\nEvraz was one of the top five most bought stocks last week by customers on the AJ Bell (AJBA.L), interactive investor (ii) and Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L) platforms, prior to the stock's suspension.\n\nIt was also the stock with the highest buy-to-sell ratio on the Freetrade platform. All four cater specifically to retail investors, non-professionals who trade securities through online platforms.\n\nThe UK has claimed in its sanctions that Evraz has helped provide financial support towards destabilising Ukraine and may have supplied steel used for the production of Russian tanks. Evraz denies the claims.\n\nAJ Bell said Evraz holdings would remain in customer portfolios at the price it was suspended at, while ii said shares were being held until further information was available.\n\nPolymetal was also one of the top 10 most bought stocks last week across the platforms reviewed by Reuters and was top of AJ Bell's list.\n\nThe company is not subject to UK sanctions and its shares are still trading, although the stock was deleted from indexes by FTSE Russell on Monday after many brokers refused to trade its shares. read more\n\nPolymetal, which has eight gold and silver mines in Russia and makes most of its revenues in the country, has said the situation in Ukraine is \"horrifying and heartbreaking\", and has called for a peaceful resolution."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nCarlota Guerrero: the Spanish photographer reframing the female body\nGuerrero has had a meteoric rise since capturing Solange\u2019s album cover in 2016. A new book charts her work to date, exploring her desire to carve out a space of liberation for her female subjects\n\nPhotographer Carlota Guerrero has a vivid memory from her early childhood. In the introduction of her new photobook, she recalls \u201csitting at my desk during school, fantasizing about climbing up on the teacher\u2019s table and taking off my clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers try to stop me, but I flee and run naked like a gazelle, through the corridors, the courtyard of the school and the gymnasium, and through all the public spaces. I feel terribly guilty for having imagined it.\u201d\n\nThis fantasy of escape and liberation remains the central thread of her photography. The self-taught photographer, who is from Barcelona, has been exploring these themes of femininity, body autonomy and exploration for a decade. After being gifted an Olga film camera as a teenager, she started out capturing her friend group\u2019s blissful, naked afternoons by the Mediterranean, and the freedom they felt in each other\u2019s company.\n\nShe credits an LSD trip for furthering this idea of female interconnectedness. \u201cWhen I bring women together in one place and photograph them, I am creating new organisms... as if each woman were an organ or a cell that, by joining the others, makes up a whole being,\u201d she writes.\n\nShe was in her mid-20s when she got her big break. Musician Solange Knowles contacted the then-unknown photographer after seeing her work on Instagram. Guerrero captured the musician in her trademark soft earth tones, hair full of colourful clips to hold the waves of her hair in place, for the cover of her 2016 album Seat at the Table.\n\nIt was a meeting of minds \u2013 Knowles\u2019s wistful, dreamy vision which exposes the awkward hidden details of womanhood dovetailed perfectly with Guerrero\u2019s own offbeat exploration of sensuality and healing. Guerrero would go on to collaborate with Solange on music videos and shoot her next album cover, When I Get Home.\n\nSince her fruitful collaboration with Knowles, Guerrero has become one of the most in-demand photographers working today. She has photographed musicians Arca and Rosalia and the poet Rupi Kaur. She\u2019s worked with fashion royalty, from Helmut Lang to Dior to Philip Lim. During 2019\u2019s Miami Art Basel show, she caused a viral sensation with her performance piece \u201cLove Different\u201d, in partnership with Spanish brand Desigual. The performance ended in a writhing mass of 30 bodies which included Lourdes Leon, Madonna\u2019s daughter.\n\nHer work to date is now collected in Tengo un Dragon Dentro del Corazon: The Photographs of Carlota Guerrero, a new photobook from Prestel, showcasing her distinctive low-contrast tones, seen with a warm and tranquil eye. Guerrero has said in interviews that her aesthetic vision stands in contrast with her own restless, anxious personality. She is also constantly working to see women\u2019s bodies in a different way, from a point of view of joy and camaraderie free from the male gaze.\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, Rupi Kaur recalls a shoot with Guerrero in which she \u201cended up naked in a bed of pink rose petals at her Barcelona studio.\u201d She points out that Guerrero\u2019s fixation on the female body is an attempt to reframe and reclaim them in popular visual culture. It goes beyond representation, even though the women she photographs vary in shape, size and skin tone. Although they tap into a raw sensuality, they are a million miles away from the women offered up for consumption in the pages of magazines Guerrero and her generation grew up seeing.\n\n\u201cCarlota\u2019s work is the antidote to our male-gaze problem,\u201d Kaur writes. \u201cIn an industry dominated by men shooting women\u2019s bodies, Carlota\u2019s vision is refreshing. As a woman, I\u2019m not interested in looking at my body through the eyes of a man anymore. I\u2019ve done that my whole life. I want to see and be shot by a woman whose images are celebrative, not exploitative. Sexy, not voyeuristic. In a world where the feminine is violated, the femininity that Carlota captures is honest and empowering.\u201d"}

Manek led all scorers with 26 points on just 13 shots when he left the court.\n\nBaylor quickly ripped off a 20-4 run \u2014 aided by North Carolina point guard Caleb Love fouling out as well \u2014 and were able to apply pressure thanks to Adam Flagler ripping off a huge second half. The Bears continued to hound the Tar Heels, with James Akinjo tying the game at 80 with an and-one with 15.8 seconds left. RJ Davis' attempt to tie the game in regulation bounced off the rim.\n\nBaylor closed the final 10:08 of the first half on a 38-13 run.\n\nIn overtime, the two teams stayed close until Davis dropped in a left-handed layup and was fouled making the free throw for a six-point lead. He finished with a game-high 30 points, including 17 in the first half as North Carolina built its original lead."}

Although his research took place in the 50s, his description of the idea took place in the later 60s.\n\nRay Bradbury\u2019s short story A Sound of Thunder, first published in Collier's magazine in the June 28, 1952 issue and Playboy in June 1956 deals with, and actually includes, a butterfly and most definitely explains the idea in a fantastic way better adapted to lay explanation than the good physics professor Lorenz.\n\nTime Safari Inc., for a sizeable fee, will take a client back in time, WAY back, so that they can hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But overly conscious of any possible effect on future time (the butterfly effect) great measures are taken to ensure that as little impact on time is allowed. Time Safari employees mark possible huntee animals as those who would have died anyway and a gravity defying path is formed to protect every blade of ancient grass.\n\nBut what happens when a hunter walks off the path?\n\nBradbury demonstrates AGAIN that he is the literary equivalent to Chuck Norris, kicking ass, taking names, and teaching physics without a chalkboard to generations of SF/F readers."}

But she\u2019s far from forgotten, thanks to the work of Houston\u2019s estate and its partners at Primary Wave Music, who continue to unspool plans that will keep the superstar\u2019s legacy top of mind for years to come.\n\nA renewed focus on Houston\u2019s music began as soon as Primary Wave partnered with the estate in 2019, taking a 50% stake in the singer\u2019s music assets.\n\n\u201cIt was time to rebuild Whitney\u2019s business and Primary Wave, with its arsenal of industry professionals, were the right fit, a team packaged to elevate Whitney\u2019s legacy to the next level,\u201d says Pat Houston, the late artist\u2019s sister-in-law and former manager, who serves as an executor of her estate.\n\n\u201cWe have massively, over the course of our three-year partnership, improved the earnings of the estate,\u201d adds Primary Wave founder and CEO Larry Mestel. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically quadrupled the earnings stream of the estate through a lot of low-hanging fruit: renegotiation of partnerships, focusing on merchandise, digital strategy and social media enhancement \u2014 upping the game in general.\u201d\n\nThe first salvo in the company\u2019s stewardship was a Kygo remix of Houston covering Steve Winwood hit \u201cHigher Love.\u201d The 2019 version reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Play chart and No. 7 on Adult Contemporary radio, not only sparking streaming gains for her body of work, but spurring a series of branding and merchandise opportunities.\n\nMestel sees even greater growth on the horizon, starting with the Dec. 23 premiere of the Kasi Lemmons-directed biopic \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody.\u201d\nCan you summarize this into 2 bullet points please?"}

{"prompt": "I require a catchy headline for the following article outlne. Can you help? - Researcher Kristin Neff distinguishes in her TED talk between self-esteem and self-compassion. While Neff says self-esteem comes from believing we are better than others, self-compassion directs us to love ourselves simply as we are. Self-compassion was shown in one study to help improve body dissatisfaction and motivate people to continue self-improvement efforts. Neff says self-compassion can be as simple as changing the language we use with ourselves. For example, if you went ahead and ate that damn cookie, don't beat yourself up for it. Instead of thinking how terrible you are for eating the cookie, remind yourself that you'll do better tomorrow.\n\n\"Exercise is as much a physical training as mental,\" says Sassy Gregson-Williams, founder of Naturally Sassy, a Global Online Workout Studio, Recipe Platform and App. \"These patterns are so ingrained in us, we want instantaneous results, and if we stray from that narrow unattainable path we set for ourselves we feel defeated.

{"prompt": "Pull some key points from the following blog post so I can give it as a slide deck presentation - Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.\n\nIt recognizes the new power of the best consumers to ignore marketing. It realizes that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.\n\nPay attention is a key phrase here, because permission marketers understand that when someone chooses to pay attention they are actually paying you with something precious. And there\u2019s no way they can get their attention back if they change their mind. Attention becomes an important asset, something to be valued, not wasted.\n\nReal permission is different from presumed or legalistic permission. Just because you somehow get my email address doesn\u2019t mean you have permission. Just because I don\u2019t complain doesn\u2019t mean you have permission. Just because it\u2019s in the fine print of your privacy policy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s permission either.\n\nReal permission works like this: if you stop showing up, people complain, they ask where you went.\n\nI got a note from a Daily Candy reader the other day. He was upset because for three days in a row, his Daily Candy newsletter hadn\u2019t come. That\u2019s permission.\n\nPermission is like dating. You don\u2019t start by asking for the sale at first impression. You earn the right, over time, bit by bit.\n\nOne of the key drivers of permission marketing, in addition to the scarcity of attention, is the extraordinarily low cost of dripping to people who want to hear from you. RSS and email and other techniques mean you don\u2019t have to worry about stamps or network ad buys every time you have something to say. Home delivery is the milkman\u2019s revenge... it\u2019s the essence of permission.\n\nPermission doesn\u2019t have to be formal but it has to be obvious. My friend has permission to call me if he needs to borrow five dollars, but the person you meet at a trade show has no such ability to pitch you his entire resume, even though he paid to get in.\n\nSubscriptions are an overt act of permission. That\u2019s why home delivery newspaper readers are so valuable, and why magazine subscribers are worth more than newsstand ones.\n\nIn order to get permission, you make a promise. You say, \u201cI will do x, y and z, I hope you will give me permission by listening.\u201d And then, this is the hard part, that\u2019s all you do. You don\u2019t assume you can do more. You don\u2019t sell the list or rent the list or demand more attention. You can promise a newsletter and talk to me for years, you can promise a daily RSS feed and talk to me every three minutes, you can promise a sales pitch every day (the way Woot does). But the promise is the promise until both sides agree to change it. You don\u2019t assume that just because you\u2019re running for President or coming to the end of the quarter or launching a new product that you have the right to break the deal. You don\u2019t.\n\nPermission doesn\u2019t have to be a one-way broadcast medium. The internet means you can treat different people differently, and it demands that you figure out how to let your permission base choose what they hear and in what format.\n\nWhen I launched my book that coined this phrase 9 years ago, I offered people a third of the book for free in exchange for an email address. And I never, ever did anything with those addresses again. That wasn\u2019t part of the deal. No follow ups, no new products. A deal\u2019s a deal.\n\nIf it sounds like you need humility and patience to do permission marketing, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s why so few companies do it properly. The best shortcut, in this case, is no shortcut at all."}

The Americans witness the Norwegian passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot shoots at the dog and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burned remains of a malformed humanoid which they recover to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, performs autopsies on the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.\n\nClark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the new creature and learns that it can perfectly imitate other organisms. Recovered Norwegian data leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Norris estimates that the alien ship has been buried for at least 100,000 years. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates that the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The station implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.\n\nThe malformed humanoid creature assimilates an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. Blair sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. The team imprisons him in a tool shed. Copper suggests a test to compare each member's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning that the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry, and MacReady takes command.\n\nMacReady, Windows and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. On their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack.\n\nAs Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady is forced to kill Clark in self-defense when the latter lunges at him from behind with a knife. He hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing's head demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life form with its own survival instinct. He has everyone tied up and sequentially tests blood samples with a heated piece of wire. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood jumps from the heat. Exposed, Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both.\n\nChilds is left on guard while the others go to test Blair. They find that Blair has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer. On their return, Childs is missing and the power generator is destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to detonate the entire station to destroy the Thing. As they set explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Transforming into an enormous creature, Blair-Thing destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the explosives using a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.\n\nMacReady sits nearby as the station burns. Childs returns, saying he became lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch."}

People do not travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides this, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays in one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. It also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveller can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of another country.

For those who simply can\u2019t choose, there\u2019s also a Dole Whip flight containing all six featured swirl flavors.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest: We\u2019re in it for the Sangria Float, a combination of Dole Whip and red wine sangria. It\u2019s going to make waiting in line with screaming toddlers *that much* more tolerable. (We joke, kind of.)\n\nSwirls on the Water is officially open in Disney Springs as of March 15."}

Albert Einstein (/\u02c8a\u026ansta\u026an/ EYEN-styne;[6] German: [\u02c8alb\u025b\u0281t \u02c8\u0294a\u026an\u0283ta\u026an] (audio speaker iconlisten); 14 March 1879 \u2013 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][8] His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\".[9] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\",[12] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\".[13]\n\nIn 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[14] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[15][16] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light."}
{"prompt": "The Batman is the best live-action Batman movie to be released within the last decade. It shows a new and refreshing take on the caped crusader and brings some lesser-known Batman villains back into live-action. The Batman serves as a worthy interpretation of Batman which makes its predecessors proud by giving audiences a comic-accurate Batman to grace the big screen.\n\nBefore the film was released, one big worry for the film was casting Robert Pattinson as Batman. How could the brooding Twilight star take on the caped crusader? In all honesty, he does it well. Luckily, both parts called for brooding. Ever since Christian Bale\u2019s Batman, each subsequent interpretation seems only to try and make Batman darker, grittier, and raspier in his speech. \n\nPattinson keeps true to this sentiment. Pattinson captures Batman\u2019s dual nature of hardened vigilante and inquisitive detective masterfully, but his interpretation of playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne, the true mask that Bruce puts on, could have benefitted from some more variety in respect to his Batman. Pattinson\u2019s Bruce Wayne feels like Batman without the suit, and there is little difference between the two in their demeanor and voice.\n\nThe Zo\u00eb Kravitz Catwoman also does a better job at portraying the feline thief than her The Dark Knight Rises counterpart. Seeing Selina Kyle in her humble apartment with her myriad of stray cats helps set the tone of who Catwoman is, a low-level cat burglar. The Batman also helps humanize Catwoman by adding two stirring emotional plots driving her throughout the film instead of the simple desire to steal shiny objects. Understandably, Catwoman\u2019s suit is what an average person without billions of dollars would be able to put together, but perhaps a minor upgrade to the suit within the film would have been appreciated. The ski mask covering half of her face beings to look silly in comparison to Batman\u2019s suit.  Can you summarize this article into 3 bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentence:\n\nCyprus\u2019 graffiti paints a rich and complex picture of a society divided\nStreet art in Cyprus does more than attract tourists \u2013 it tells the story of the country\u2019s rich, and complicated, history \n\nAll too often, graffiti is categorised as either art or vandalism, when in fact it\u2019s so much more than that. When read with special attention, graffiti can offer deep insights into societies experiencing rapid social and political change \u2013 especially those marred by recent conflict.\n\nThe walls of a city give communities and individuals who may not have a formal platform space to share their feelings and opinions, and challenge dominant beliefs or ideals.\n\nAs researchers interested in societies recovering from disaster or conflict, we recently took a trip to explore graffiti in Cyprus. Cyprus and its capital, Nicosia, have remained divided since 1974, following the Turkish invasion and ensuing conflict.\n\nThe Turkish-Cypriot state in the north (recognised only by Turkey) is separated from the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus in the south by a UN-controlled buffer zone.\n\nCrossings between the two sides are only permitted through closely monitored checkpoints, leaving the Cypriot people physically, politically and culturally divided.\n\nIn places like this, graffiti can both reflect and shape community attitudes at a grassroots level. By seriously examining graffiti as a cultural product of such societies, we can better understand these divisions and work towards peacebuilding.\n\nThe power of graffiti\n\nGraffiti encompasses a wide variety of motivations and styles: anything from tagging to more artistic forms of expression like murals. Research has investigated how graffiti can be a channel for political participation and informal education. It\u2019s a medium widely associated with urban subcultures formed around punk, hip-hop and skateboarding along with many other social movements over the decades.\n\nViews about the value of graffiti can vary just as widely. Authorities, artists and members of the public tend to take different stances, which can also depend on context, content and style. Graffiti has sometimes been linked to social disorder and decline, but it can also add cultural value or in some cases lead to \u201cartwashing\u201d and gentrification. Certainly, it has the power to influence the character of a place, and change urban landscapes over time.\n\nWhen searching for meaning in graffiti, we must look at its form and content. For example, pieces of plain writing may initially seem quite simple, but things like language choices can be telling.\n\nIn Nicosia, Turkish and Greek messages were painted with meaning for each respective \u201cinside\u201d group, while English was used to address a wider, international audience. So language choice is indirectly related to the ethno-nationalist conflict, and acts as an informal commentary on people\u2019s experiences of the city.\n\nInevitably, we saw many references to division and conflict in the graffiti of Nicosia. But we also saw pieces related to local gang tags, local politics, anti-sexism and the patriarchy, racism, migrant worker rights, refugees, consumerism, veganism and LGBT+ inclusion \u2013 among other topics.\n\nThis suggests local people are seeing beyond the past conflict in their daily lives. But it also suggests existing formal platforms for these issues to be addressed may not be effective or leave some feeling disillusioned. So people turn to city walls.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nLarger scale murals across Cyprus are beautifully and skilfully painted \u2013 and equally interesting. In war-torn, damaged urban landscapes, they can be seen as an attempt to make the spaces more aesthetically appealing or to make a larger statement. These are often commissioned, and are even incorporated into official peacebuilding initiatives, art festivals and tourism strategies.\n\nA mural in the southern city of Limassol, depicting a Nepali woman and her child, was painted shortly after the 2015 earthquake; unrelated to the Cypriot conflict itself, it affirms that Cypriot artists are outward-looking and aware of turmoil beyond their own borders (not always common in conflict zones).\n\nSymbols are commonly used in street art across the world to deliver powerful political statements instantly. Internationally recognised symbols make a visual connection to transnational communities, ideologies and movements.\n\nIn Nicosia, common symbols included the Communist hammer and sickle, the Anarchist symbol, the peace sign, doves, gender signs and even swastikas. These symbols have broad, universal meanings attached to them so that no matter where the audience is from (Cyprus receives more than 3m tourists per year), the message is understood.\n\nLocation matters\n\nWhere graffiti is painted also tells a significant story: we saw that location influenced both the amount and the content of graffiti. The old city of Nicosia has lots of buffer zone walls and barriers, and a border crossing on the main shopping thoroughfare.\n\nThe areas closest to crossings contained mostly English language messages, explicitly about the conflict. Further away from the buffer zone, we observed less graffiti, and the messages become more varied.\n\nWe can speculate, then, that the division might have a greater influence on daily life, the closer people are to the dividing wall. This highly contextual insight has the potential to enhance our understanding of the unique experiences of local people in conflict-affected zones.\n\nOur early investigations of graffiti have already told us much about life in conflict-affected Cyprus. Clearly, the importance of graffiti should not be overlooked: it can open a window into the lives and minds of many people, who might otherwise lack a voice."}

Salsa dance socials are commonly held in nightclubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially when part of an outdoor festival.\n\nSalsa's tempo ranges from about 150 bpm (beats per minute) to around 250 bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm.[4] The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd number of steps creates the syncopation inherent to salsa dancing and ensures that it takes eight beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps."}

{"prompt": "Please summarize the article below into three concise sentences:\n\nHow English Photographer Anna Atkins Captured the Science of Botany\nA pioneer in 19th century photography, Anna Atkins was the first to demonstrated the full creative potential of the cyanotype.\n\nIn 1841, English photographer Anna Atkins created her very first photograph. Many historians believe that Atkins was the first female photographer in the world. While there is no evidence to definitively prove that she was indeed the first, Atkins nonetheless helped pave the way for generations of women photographers to exercise their curiosity and creativity.\n\nAtkins\u2019 medium of choice was cyanotype photography, a camera-less technique that allowed her to capture detailed silhouettes of plant specimens on light-sensitive paper, which turned a brilliant shade of blue when developed in sunlight. Throughout her prolific career, Atkins combined the scientific impulse to make discoveries and document them accurately with the artistic impulse to create an object of beauty.\n\nIntroducing Anna Atkins: Britain\u2019s First Botanical Photographer\n\nFrom early childhood in Kent, England, Anna Atkins\u2019 unusual education and relationships helped shape her trajectory toward becoming Britain\u2019s first botanical photographer. Born Anna Children in 1799, Atkins was raised by her father, who was a well-respected scientist in the fields of chemistry and zoology. Unlike most English women in the 19th century, Atkins received a thorough education on scientific topics, including botany, and even contributed engravings to her father\u2019s published work. Atkins also had a close, lifelong relationship with a woman named Anne Dixon, a childhood friend who lived with the Children family and with whom Atkins collaborated on botanical photography experiments throughout her career.\n\nWhen Atkins married, she moved with her husband to a family estate in Kent, where she enjoyed the luxuries of time and space to collect and study all the plant specimens that the English countryside has to offer. Atkins never had children, and she spent her days investigating, collecting, and cataloging various flora\u2014and eventually photographing them.\n\nAtkins learned about photography\u2014a new phenomenon in 19th-century England\u2014through correspondence with its inventor, her friend William Henry Fox Talbot. Another family friend, John Herschel, introduced his own invention of cyanotype photography to Atkins in 1841. (Herschel also mentored another female English photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron.) Atkins was instantly drawn to the cyanotype process. Within a year of learning this camera-less technique, Atkins had already mastered it, creating dozens of striking blue and white images of the plant specimens she had collected.\n\nThe Science of Photography and the Cyanotype Process\n\nCyanotype photography, also called sun printing or blueprinting, is a photography technique that, compared to other methods in the 1840s, was accessible and affordable for an amateur English photographer like Anna Atkins. This process did not require owning a camera or having access to expensive chemical materials. To create cyanotype, the photographer begins with paper that is chemically treated with a light-sensitive solution of ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide. The object to be recorded is placed on the paper and the entire piece is exposed to sunlight for around fifteen minutes. Then, the piece is brought back indoors, the object removed, and the cyanotype image is fixed on the paper by washing it in plain water, at which point the uncovered areas of the paper turn blue, and the image appears as a white negative. The result is a highly detailed, highly contrasted silhouette of the subject.\n\nThe cyanotype process went on to become especially popular with architects and engineers, who used the process to make copies\u2014or blueprints\u2014of their designs. For Anna Atkins, she saw in cyanotype photography the potential to create accurate, scientifically useful records of her botanical specimen collection for study and reproduction.\n\n \n\nThe Rise of the Botanical Photograph: How Atkins Captured Plants \n\nMaking a record of a plant specimen with the requisite quality and accuracy to be scientifically useful is notoriously difficult when using drawing or engraving as the method of reproduction. Although Anna Atkins was experienced and skilled at scientific engraving, she found that the highly detailed silhouette of the cyanotype, which was created directly from the specimen itself, was a more scientific method than any attempts to render what she saw by hand.\n\n \n\nAfter being taught the process by its inventor, the English photographer turned to cyanotype photography instead of traditional illustration to record botanical specimens for her first scientific reference book on British algae. Atkins explained, \u201cI have lately taken in hand a rather lengthy performance. It is the taking photographical impressions of all, that I can procure, of the British algae and confervae are, many of which are so minute that accurate drawings of them are very difficult to make.\u201d\n\n \n\nHer comprehensive and successful efforts at botanical cyanotype photography helped establish photography as an accurate and effective medium for scientific illustration. But Atkins\u2019 work stretched even beyond the scope of science. The English photographer also experimented with creating artistic compositions of her specimens and layering them with other objects, like lace and feathers. Such exercises demonstrated that photography could be a legitimate vehicle for exploring aesthetic properties like shape, form, texture, and transparency in addition to facilitating pure scientific accuracy.\n\nThe English Photographer\u2019s \u201cPhotographs of British Algae\u201d\n\nIn 1843, Anna Atkins self-published the first volume of her first photography book: Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions. Although it was privately published with a very limited number of copies, it is considered to be the first published book to be illustrated with photographs. Atkins published a total of three volumes of British algae photographs between 1843 and 1853.\n\n \n\nWhen she began working on Photographs of British Algae, the study of algae had recently been legitimized by an 1841 publication by William Harvey titled Manual of British Algae. Atkins originally set out to contribute cyanotype illustrations to Harvey\u2019s original publication, which did not include any images, but she ended up gathering her own specimens and labeling and organizing them herself. Instead of using traditional letterpress printing to label the specimens, Atkins incorporated handwriting that was created through the cyanotype process, demonstrating the attention she paid to the aesthetic properties of her specimens. In fact, Atkins was specifically drawn to the elegant and organic shapes of the algae\u2014or \u201cflowers of the sea\u201d as many called them\u2014and their potential to form beautiful compositions on the page.\n\nHer main goal was to create a volume of accurate reproductions of algae species that could be used for studies. The complete book contains over 400 types of algae with numerous images of each specimen. Atkins\u2019 approach to creating the book was as innovative as it was involved. Every page of every copy of Photographs of British Algae was produced entirely by hand, so over the course of a decade, Atkins only completed around a dozen completed copies of her book, some of which are now preserved and sometimes exhibited at major cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Library."}

Born in Bulgaria in 1941, she moved to France at the age of 23, and here she became a leader in philosophy, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Her writing has encompassed various subjects including sociology, psychoanalysis, literary criticism and art history. She has also published more than 30 books and leading scholarly essays, and been awarded a series of prestigious prizes including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize. Let\u2019s take a look at her life and work in more detail.\n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leader In Semiotics\n\nThroughout her career, Kristeva has pursued the subject of semiotics, or the study of signs, symbols and language. She trained in linguistics at the University of Sofia, before moving to France in the 1960s. In France, Kristeva became a member of the Tel Quel group, a band of French academics who published the literary journal Tel Quel. The journal gave Kristeva a platform to explore ideas around the politics of language. \n\nTwo of Her Most Important Early Publications Explored Semiotics\n\nKristeva\u2019s early work with Tel Quel became the foundation for her first two publications, Semeiotik\u00e8 (1969) and La R\u00e9volution du langage po\u00e9tique (The Revolution of Poetic Language) (1974). These texts drew on Freudian, Lacanian, and Kleinian psychoanalysis, examining how language, culture and ideologies are built out of unconscious body and gender-based dimensions. Further training in psychoanalysis in the 1970s deepened Kristeva\u2019s belief that unconscious emotions and feelings are intertwined with the meaning invested into our forms of communication.\n\n \n\nAfter the Birth of Her Son, Julia Kristeva Became Increasingly Interested In Child Psychology\n\nFollowing the birth of her son in the 1970s, Kristeva began exploring the semiotic link between mother and child. Her iconic text of this period was Pouvoirs de l\u2019horreur (Powers of Horror) (1980/1982), which explored the power struggle between mother and child as the child eventually rejects their mother in order to find themselves. She calls this rejection of the mother \u201cabjection\u201d, and she believed her notion of the abject would come to replay throughout the human\u2019s adult life in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nKristeva Wrote About the Role of Abjection In Adulthood\n\nSome of Kristeva\u2019s most graphic and disturbing writing explains how we experience the \u201cabject\u201d as adults. She outlines the kinds of horrible, unappealing objects, smells or experiences we naturally reject, such as milk-skin, fingernail clippings, dead bodies, human waste and so on... Not the most enjoyable read. But it does give us a fascinating insight into the workings of the human mind, and the way we respond to external stimuli outside our own body. \n\nJulia Kristeva Is a Leading Feminist\n\nAmong her many achievements, Kristeva has been recognized as a leader in feminist theory. She has written extensively about women\u2019s bodies, particularly in relation to motherhood, and the role they play as a primal source of rhythm, tone and movement for every human being before it comes into the real world. One of her most important feminist essays is Women\u2019s Time (1979). In this work she argues there are three types of feminism. The first, which seeks universal equality, overlooking any sexual differences. The second phase emphasizes a uniquely feminine language, which she ultimately disregards as impossible, because she believes gender is too diverse to easily categorize. The third phase of Kristeva\u2019s feminism explores multiple identities, suggesting there are as many different kinds of sexualities are there are people. It\u2019s a fascinating theory that is particularly relevant for today\u2019s culture, which has opened up many debates about the complexities of gender, sexuality and identity."}

Learning to sail isn\u2019t just for kids! Learning to sail opens the door to enjoying the euphoric and freeing sensations sailing delivers. Recent research conducted by one of the leading researchers on the health benefits of the water, Dr. Wallace J. Nichols, marine biologist and author of Blue Mind, confirms a long-held instinct that the water is good for our health, both physical and mental.\n\nHis research shows that being on the water on a boat promotes physiological and psychological changes spanning health and wellness, awe and wonder, creativity and play, and happiness and relaxation:\n\nBoating resets our brain: Being on the water has been shown to offer relaxation, restoration, and happiness, along with the added benefits of exercise, social time, and a connection with nature.\nBoating is meditative: Time spent in nature, especially when it involves water, provides a way to offset the stresses of living and working in modern contexts.\nBoating promotes play and induces creativity: Stress is shown to inhibit creativity. Watersports and aquatic activities are playful activities that trigger the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good chemicals. \nBoating appeals to our senses: The mere sight of water can induce neurochemicals that promote wellness. A lifelong relationship to water, achieved through boating, delivers cognitive, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual benefits for people of all ages and abilities."}
{"prompt": "Please parse the following - Associazione Sportiva Roma (BIT: ASR, LSE: 0MT1; Rome Sport Association), commonly referred to as Roma (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8ro\u02d0ma]), is an Italian professional football club based in Rome. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for the 1951\u201352 season. Roma have won Serie A three times, in 1941\u201342, 1982\u201383 and 2000\u201301, as well as nine Coppa Italia titles and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. In European competitions, Roma has won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960\u201361 and were runners-up in the 1983\u201384 European Cup and the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup.\n\nFifteen players have won the FIFA World Cup while playing at Roma: Attilio Ferraris and Enrique Guaita (1934); Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio (1934 and 1938); Aldo Donati and Pietro Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi Voller and Thomas Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Vincent Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta and Francesco Totti (2006).\n\nSince 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the Stadio Olimpico, a venue they share with city rivals Lazio. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the second-largest of its kind in Italy, with only the San Siro able to seat more. The club plan to move to a new stadium, though it is yet to start construction. Having a strong local rivalry, Roma and Lazio contest Derby della Capitale.\n\nThe club's home colours are carmine red and golden yellow, which gives Roma their nickname \"I Giallorossi\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\"). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome."}

{"prompt": "How many way are there to celebrate achievement in the following post? So, how can you acknowledge and applaud success? Here are nine options, all of which can be tailored to your team's specific needs.\n\n1. Just say it. A straightforward, face-to-face \"well done\" is a simple but effective way to celebrate achievement. A personal email can be sufficient, too, and a handwritten card or note can add a valuable personal touch.\n\nGathering the team together to acknowledge success can be a powerful statement, and a round of applause can be uplifting and team-building \u2013 but take care not to embarrass anyone.\n\n2. Share success stories. A group message is another option. Tailor it to the specific person and their achievement, but don't overuse this method or it could come across as formulaic.\n\nYou can use email, the company newsletter, social media, or a messaging platform to share and celebrate success stories. You could even set up a dedicated channel to highlight and congratulate people for jobs well done. This has the added benefit of raising your team member's profile .\n\n3. Pay it forward. When you're celebrating an achievement of your own, show your gratitude by acknowledging the people who helped to make it happen. Always look out for opportunities to help other people to succeed, so that they have a reason to celebrate, too.\n\nAnd when team members share good news, always try to respond positively . Positive reinforcements further enhance team morale.\n\n4. Give a gift. A celebratory gift could be a one-off cash bonus, or a non-cash equivalent, such as a retail or experience voucher. Cash is often the most popular reward, but think very carefully about how other employees might perceive it. Bear in mind that some team members may already be incentivized with cash bonuses.\n\nTry to avoid setting a precedent: you don't want recognition to become just an impersonal cash transaction.\n\nGifts such as food or flowers are a relatively inexpensive yet powerful way of recognizing achievement. Make sure that you consider any dietary or allergy issues. There may also be cultural sensitivities around giving gifts that you should be aware of.\n\n5. Get together socially. Celebrating by buying team members a meal or drink can be an effective way to reward them and to boost team spirit. However, beware excluding anyone who, for example, is away on vacation, has special dietary requirements, or has caregiving responsibilities .\n\nIf you hold your event during the working day, be mindful of colleagues' deadlines and be clear about whether you expect them to return to work afterward.\n\n6. Organize a team day out. A trip to the movies, a meal at a restaurant, attending a sporting event, or even a day of outdoor activities are all common ways of celebrating. But there are potential risks to keep in mind, too.\n\nEveryone will likely have a different idea of \"fun,\" so try to find an activity that will be popular across the board. You won't want anyone to be unhappy or refuse to take part. This is a particular risk with physical or outdoor activities that might be difficult for some people, for health, accessibility or confidence reasons.\n\nOnce you've agreed on a suitable event, further questions to answer might be:\n\nWhat's included in the day at the company's expense?\nIs there anyone who'd find it hard to afford the other parts of the day?\nCan people bring family members?\nIf so, will those family members have to pay their own way?\nWhere does that leave colleagues who are single or without children?\n7. Offer extra holiday. Time off can be a great reward, especially when your team has worked extra hours to complete a project. But would working late occasionally for no particular reason also count as an achievement? Be careful about creating false expectations for the future.\n\n8. Set up a hall of fame. An \"employee of the week\" noticeboard or notification can be popular and effective, but it can lose impact over time.\n\nYou risk accusations of tokenism if you feel obliged to choose someone rather than no one, whether they deserve it or not. And if you keep recognizing a \"star\" team member, or constantly overlook another, you might start to alienate people.\n\n9. Have an awards ceremony. A glitzy evening of music, trophies and speeches is an exciting way to combine socializing, team building and networking with formal recognition and celebration.\n\nIf you have the budget, you can hire a venue and a professional events team. However, if you want to limit the expense and increase participation, get your team involved in managing and running the event, including making the food and costumes. This will be fun and rewarding in itself!\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Use your imagination and judgment to create your own celebrations \u2013 and see what happens to productivity and job satisfaction when your people feel celebrated and recognized for their work."}

Cool the burn. Immediately immerse the burn in cool tap water or apply cold, wet compresses. Do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides.\n\n2. Apply petroleum jelly two to three times daily. Do not apply ointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn, as these may cause an infection. Do not apply topical antibiotics.\n\n3. Cover the burn with a nonstick, sterile bandage. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered. Do not pop the blisters.\n\n4. Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation.\n\n5. Protect the area from the sun. Once the burn heals, protect the area from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. This will help minimize scarring, as the redness from a burn sometimes persists for weeks, especially in those with darker skin tones."}

It\u2019s in the Stars\n\nLONDON \u2014 The three-story mural showing a workman chipping away at one of the 12 stars of the European Union flag appeared mysteriously in Dover, England, over the weekend, at once banal and symbolically poignant.\n\nBefore the paint had dried, social media was swirling with the well-trodden guessing game as to whether the intricate stenciled imagery belonged to Banksy, the enigmatic and anonymous guerrilla street artist whose work has graced walls from Britain to the West Bank.\n\nThe mystery was solved when Banksy posted photographs of the work on his official Instagram feed on Sunday, perhaps timed to coincide with the French presidential vote \u2014 which, as it turned out, the young and ardently pro-European Union former investment banker Emmanuel Macron won decisively.\n\nThe election solidified France\u2019s place at the center of the European Union and highlighted Britain\u2019s position on the outside looking in.\n\nThe timing and location of the installation infused it with added resonance. Britons will vote next month in a general election that Prime Minister Theresa May has justified on the grounds that it will buttress her position in tortuous negotiations to leave the European Union, known as Brexit.\n\n\u201cThey ought to make it the Brexit logo,\u201d a resident of Dover, where a majority voted to leave the bloc, told the website kentnews.co.uk. (The stars in the circle are intended to symbolize unity and do not refer to the number of member states.)\n\nOthers were less impressed. \u201cIs it really Banksy?\u201d Jan Honza Zicha wrote on Facebook. \u201cI remember time when he was \u2018on to subject\u2019 before anyone else or at least part of the first liners. Unfortunately this time, he is about 10 months too late and the art work is truly ... well obvious and uninnovative.\u201d\n\nMalcolm John Haines wrote on Facebook, \u201cAnother boring piece of \u2018art\u2019 from the left wing\u2019s favourite millionaire luvvie.\u201d\n\nBut Mel Lloyd, an ecologist, lauded the strategic placement of the mural, on a building next to the A20, a main road not far from the Dover ferry terminal, one of the country\u2019s main gateways to Europe. \u201cHuge, fabulous, strategically placed new Banksyesque graffiti in Dover on A20,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cTraffic leaving Dover Port will see this.\u201d\n\nBanksy, whose zealous guarding of his identity helps maintain interest in his work, is no stranger to political art.\n\nIn 2015, he created several artworks at a ramshackle migrant camp in Calais, France, known as the Jungle, where thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere lived while trying to find a way to reach Britain. One work showed the Apple founder Steve Jobs, an apparent reminder that Mr. Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.\n\nBanksy attracted praise and ridicule two years ago after he unveiled a satirical exhibition called Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England. The exhibition featured, among other things, mock security guards instructed to frown; a work showing a woman on a park bench being attacked by sea gulls; and a wreck of Cinderella\u2019s carriage, complete with Cinderella dangling lifelessly out of the carriage while surrounded by paparazzi, an image seemingly calculated to recall the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMore recently, the artist opened the Walled Off Hotel near the Israeli separation barrier in the West Bank, offering rooms as well as what the hotel claims is the \u201cworst view in the world.\u201d The project has been praised for focusing attention on the plight of Palestinians, but it has also been castigated as \u201coppression tourism.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Below is the text taken from a recent news article. Can you summarize the important points from it into a list for me?\n\nSouth Korea reported 102,211 coronavirus cases on Saturday, topping the 100,000 mark for a second-straight day, though down slightly from the record level reported on Friday.\nInfections have spiked as the Omicron variant ravages the country. Cases have now doubled since South Korea first surpassed 50,000 infections on February 10.\nDespite the increase in cases authorities said that social distancing measures would be only slightly eased ahead of the March 9 presidential election.\n\nAuthorities announced on Friday they would move a curfew on restaurants and cafes from 9pm to 10pm, a nod to increasing criticism from business owners.\nOther anti-pandemic rules such as a six-person cap on private gatherings, a seven-day quarantine for international arrivals, mask mandates in public spaces, and vaccine passes for a range of businesses, will be in place until at least March 13, officials said, after the election.\nMalaysian study finds ivermectin doesn\u2019t help Covid-19 patients\nMalaysian researchers have found that treatment with the anti-parasite drug ivermectin did not prevent patients with Covid-19 from becoming severely ill in a randomised clinical trial published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal on Friday.\nThe researchers said their findings do not support the use of ivermectin for patients with Covid-19.\n\nThe study enrolled 490 patients with mild to moderate illness at 20 hospitals and a Covid-19 quarantine centre in Malaysia. Everyone received standard care; half the group also received ivermectin.\n\nSevere disease developed in 21.6 per cent of the patients given ivermectin and in 17.3 per cent of those who received only standard care, the researchers said. They defined severe disease as requiring oxygen to help with breathing.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between the groups in rates of ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death, according to the study.\n\nNew Zealand registers 1,900 daily cases\nNew Zealand\u2019s Omicron surge continued on Saturday as the country registered 1,901 new Covid-19 infections, with 1,240 of the cases in the largest city of Auckland.\nIt marks the second straight day New Zealand has topped 1,900 infections, but the figure is down from Friday\u2019s record of 1,929 community cases.\nNational numbers in the Omicron outbreak have almost doubled since Wednesday, when 1,160 community cases were registered.\nAs the Omicron outbreak continues to grow in scale, Aucklanders are being warned they could wait up to five days to get their Covid test results back.\nThe news has sparked concern over how long people will need to isolate even if they don\u2019t have the virus.\n\n\u201cThere is still high demand at community testing centres in Auckland as case numbers rise, and we do understand some people are anxious at this time,\u201d Matt Hannant, director of operations at the Northern Region Health Coordination Centre, said.\n\u201cHowever, this is putting significant pressure on laboratories and means that while some results are being returned within 48 hours, an increasing number are taking up to five days.\nThat means people could be isolating at home for up to five days even if they return a negative result.\nThe Ministry of Health has echoed the request for Aucklanders not to call Healthline for results as the service is not able to provide that information.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to experience high demand at Covid-19 testing sites, including from asymptomatic people who are seeking tests for their own reassurance,\u201d the ministry said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that you only get tested if you have cold or flu symptoms, have been identified as a close contact of a case, or have been asked to get tested by a health official.\n\u201cUnnecessary testing is resulting in long waits at testing centres and could also delay results for those who urgently need them.\u201d\nThailand records highest infection total since August\nThailand reported 18,885 new infections on Saturday, its highest daily tally since August 22 last year.\nThis marks the second straight day cases have exceeded 18,000 across the country, after 18,066 new infections were registered on Friday.\nThailand has averaged more than 16,000 new infections over the past week, mostly due to the Omicron variant."}

The case of a fired Durham police sergeant gives the N.C. Supreme Court a chance to consider constitutional protection of economic liberty.\n\nThe state\u2019s highest court agreed this month to take up the case of Michael Mole\u2019. He argues Durham was wrong to fire him from his police job after a controversial 2016 hostage negotiation.\n\nA trial judge dismissed Mole\u2019s complaints. But a unanimous three-judge panel of the N.C. Court of Appeals revived Mole\u2019s lawsuit last October.\n\nWhile rejecting most of Mole\u2019s arguments, appeals judges agreed he should be allowed to continue his case under Article I, Section 1 of the N.C. Constitution. It guarantees that people in this state have the right to \u201cthe enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor.\u201d\n\nMole\u2019 is appealing the dismissal of his other claims. He says Durham violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the law. He also claims more than one violation of the \u201cfruits of their own labor\u201d clause.\n\nMeanwhile, the city urges the state Supreme Court to reject all of Mole\u2019s arguments.\n\nThe case stemmed from a June 2016 incident. Called in as a police hostage negotiator, Mole\u2019 spoke for two hours with Julius Smoot. Smoot had threatened to shoot himself while barricaded in an apartment bedroom."}

Here is the original version of the story.\n\nWhen I was 18, my boyfriend Jake (21) and I spontaneously decided to go to Canada to go bar hopping. It was a few hours away from our home, so we made the trip. After getting settled in the hotel, we went to the first bar. We had a drink, then went in search of a new bar. Jake and I were chatting and walking when a man in a big puffy coat stopped and introduced himself as Ian. He noticed we were speaking English and invited us to go bar hopping with him. Turned out he lived just a few hours from where we lived.\n\nAfter a few bars we met up with 2 of his friends and went in the strip club. Ian paid our cover charge and drinks with a HUGE wad of cash. I had never seen that much before. We started talking about weed, and Ian invited us to his hotel room to smoke. I had had way too much to drink at that point, off being sick in the bathroom after one puff. Thankfully Jake wasn't that drunk and we both eventually made our way back to the hotel. What a crazy night.\n\nThe next morning after a hangover breakfast we were walking to our car to leave when all of a sudden, Ian and his friends start calling our names. We all remarked how strange it was to run into each other again. Ian invited us all for a smoke at his friend's house.\n\nIt was a shady looking, rundown apartment. We smoke and somehow the topic turned to how Ian makes so much money. Without directly saying it, I could tell he was into drug smuggling, possibly over the border. Ian suggested that I could make some good money doing the same.. my heart dropped and I immediately felt uncomfortable. Unsafe. I needed to get out of that apartment, that city, that country. Jake looked over and saw how freaked out I was.\n\nWe casually played it off, 'Yeah okay' like he was joking, but Ian's friends started nodding their heads, suggesting where I can hide it. Jake gave Ian his real phone number (why, idk) and we said our goodbyes as we had a long drive home.\n\nJake is driving, and shortly after we take off we see Ian's car behind us. Very weird. We make a few turns, got a little lost, and he was still there. Jake made a few more erratic turns just to lose him. We both did NOT have a good feeling about Ian anymore. Finally, we made it across the border, no Ian in sight. It was a weird drive home.\n\nA week or two later, Ian called up Jake on the phone. I have no clue what was said, but I know we never picked up a call from him again.\n\nMaybe it was a close call, maybe not. But I got that deep gut-sinking feeling that something bad was going to happen if we were in Ian's presence any longer. Listen to your gut feelings."}

{"prompt": "Does this text give the movie a positive review?\n\nIt\u2019s been almost an entire decade since writer/director Ti West\u2018s last horror feature, The Sacrament. Far too long. Luckily, West ensures that the wait has been worth it with A24\u2019s X, an homage to the gritty indie horror of the \u201970s but with savage style and a deranged sense of humor that\u2019s pure Ti West. A deceptively simple setup gives way to a go-for-broke horror-comedy that leaves you breathless, both from laughter and nail-biting tension.\n\nSet in 1979 Texas, X opens to the aftermath of a bloodbath, to the befuddlement of local officials. Cut to 24 hours earlier, where a group of aspiring adult filmmakers load up in a van and drive from Houston out to the boonies to shoot. Producer Wayne (The Ring\u2019s Martin Henderson) attempts to cut every corner for their limited budget, first by securing a young cinephile to direct, RJ (Owen Campbell), who\u2019s brought girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) to assist and handle the boom mic. Wayne\u2019s enlisted his girlfriend Maxine (Mia Goth), Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and Jackson (Scott Mescudi) to star. Then he\u2019s rented a boarding house on the cheap from the reclusive, elder Howard (Stephen Ure), who warns them to stay out of his wife\u2019s sight.\n\nThe porn production quickly devolves into a fucked up horror picture when things spiral out of control.\n\nTi West's 'X' Highlights Horror Films Premiering at SXSW's 2022 Film Festival!\n\nWest has many surprises in store for X, but the first straight out of the gate is just how wickedly funny it is. From the little details like \u201cPlowing Service\u201d emblazoned across Wayne\u2019s van to the consistent tongue-in-cheek euphemisms befitting of the adult film production, X has a delightfully wicked sense of humor. Snow and Mescudi stand out for their line delivery and comedic timing; their character gags and one-liners land with perfection.\n\nThe second significant shock in store is how fiercely the filmmaker matches the comedy with the horror. While it\u2019s no surprise that West knows how to build tension, he brings it to a whole new level here. West, who co-edits with David Kashevaroff, finds ingenious and innovative ways to create edge-of-your-seat suspense through editing. Spliced scenes don\u2019t just create visual interest; they deliver potent scares. Overhead shots instill unease, a masterclass of terror and foreshadowing with gratifyingly intense payoffs later. West\u2019s intoxicating blend of style and scare-crafting creates a visceral horror experience.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even begin to cover the gore of it all. X is a crowd-pleasing doozy when it comes to brutal bloodletting and kills. Some deaths leave you queasy, and some will leave you cackling with glee. All of it is immensely satisfying.\n\nX is West firing on all cylinders. The commitment to the period is top-level, capturing the aesthetic and vibe without ever coming close to feeling pastiche. It\u2019s all the more impressive considering just how much humor gets injected, which could\u2019ve pushed this into spoof territory quickly in other hands. The editing is a masterclass, a marvel of how West structures this wild tale to maximize the tension or offer reprieve through an onslaught of terror.\n\nThen there\u2019s the cast. The lean, straightforward narrative gets straight to the goods and never wastes time on heavy exposition. It\u2019s all in the little details and the talented cast making these characters feel lived-in with a shared history. We root for this wacky, free-spirited bunch because they\u2019re so charming and genuine. Naturally, it lends well to the horror\u2019s impact.\n\nThe setting and period make for easy comparisons to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and West uses that to lull viewers before pulling the rug out from under them. They share similar DNA and pure grit, but it\u2019s a narratively different beast that demonstrates why West should be given full reign to go full throttle on deranged, savage, and intense horror-comedies more often. It\u2019s a blast.\n\nX releases in theaters on March 18, 2022."}

Mike Thompson, D-California, John Larson, D-Connecticut, and Lauren Underwood, D-Illinois, have introduced the Gas Rebate Act of 2022. The bill proposed sending Americans an \u201cenergy rebate\u201d or $100 per month with an additional $100 per dependent for the rest of 2022 in any month where the national average gas price exceeds $4 a gallon.\n\n\u201cAmericans are feeling the impact at the pump of Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and right now we must work together on commonsense policy solutions to ease the financial burden that my constituents are feeling,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe Putin Price Hike is putting strain on our economy, and I am proud to be working with Reps. Larson and Underwood to introduce this legislation to provide middle-class Americans with monthly payments to ease the financial burden of this global crises.\u201d\n\nThe rebate would follow the same guidelines as the most recent Economic Impact Payment:\n\n$100 for single filers earning less than $75,000 phasing out at $80,000\n$100 for joint filers earning less than $150,000 and phasing out at $160,000.\nThe bill does not include information on how the payments would be funded and Congress has been hesitant to restart any other form of stimulus payments, so chances of passage are unlikely. The bill comes after more than a month of record-high gas prices with little relief at the pump in sight.\n\nAs of today, the national average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. is $4.24, according to AAA."}

{"prompt": "I don't understand what this article is saying. Did the WNBA player do something to offend Russians? \"The arrest of two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist Brittney Griner has left supporters anxious about her well-being and fearful that she might become a political pawn.\n\nRussian authorities said Griner had cannabis oil in her luggage and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance \u2013 an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear exactly when Griner was arrested last month, or where she\u2019s being detained now.\n\nBut escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has stoked concerns that getting Griner out of Russia will be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Adaora Elonu, a former WBNA player who has also played in Russia, said she was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about Griner. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just very, very concerned \u2013 also knowing that she\u2019s been there for quite some time,\u201d Elonu told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nShe described feeling detached from much of the world while living in Russia. \u201cBeing in Russia, I was kind of in a bubble,\u201d Elonu said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel unsafe. I felt as if there was not much happening in that country. I know there was a lot going on outside of the country. But as far as when I was in Russia, we weren\u2019t getting much news about what was happening. Aside from my family and friends and my agent, they were letting me know about what was happening. But it was hard to balance what was actually happening and what I felt,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut once things started escalating, my agent was definitely pushing for me to get out. And I\u2019m glad I listened to his advice and got out.\u201d\n\n\u2018There are no words to express this pain\u2019\nGriner\u2019s whereabouts aren\u2019t publicly known. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment but has not heard back. A member of Russia\u2019s Federal Customs Service described the charge against Griner to Russia 24, the country\u2019s main state-owned news channel.\n\n\u201cA criminal case has been opened against an American citizen under section 2 of 229 YK RF (Russian law) for smuggling of a significant amount of drugs,\u201d Irina Begisheva of the Main Directorate for the Fight Against Smuggling of the Federal Customs Service told Russia 24.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Griner\u2019s wife described the agony of waiting.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018stay busy.\u2019 Yet, there\u2019s not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.\u201d Cherelle Griner posted Monday.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express this pain. I\u2019m hurting, we\u2019re hurting.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, she thanked supporters and asked for privacy \u201cas we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.\u201d But a member of the US House Armed Services Committee said \u201cit\u2019s going to be very difficult\u201d to get Griner out of Russia.\n\n\u201cOur diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\u201d Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cPerhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cRussia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws\u201d \u2013 though it\u2019s not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner\u2019s case. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.\u201d\n\nGriner\u2019s high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she worries Griner\u2019s case will be used for political purposes.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear is that ... she will become a political pawn,\u201d Jackson told CNN.\n\nBut the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe best news we got today was that they know about it and that she\u2019s on the agenda,\u201d Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner\u2019s hometown of Houston, told reporters.\n\nNoting a potential 10-year sentence for Griner, Jackson Lee added: \u201cWe know about Brittney Griner, and we know that we have to move on her situation.\u201d\n\nA storied career\nGriner has spent her entire WNBA career with the Phoenix Mercury and won the league\u2019s championship in 2014. The WNBA has confirmed that all other league players have departed Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLike many other WNBA players, Griner plays overseas in the offseason where salaries can be much higher than what female professional basketball players are paid in the US.\n\nShe won the EuroLeague Women championship last year with Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she has played since 2015 during her offseasons.\n\nFans around the world have called for Griner\u2019s release, with more than 34,000 people signing the \u201cSecure Brittney Griner\u2019s Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.\u201d petition on Change.org as of Tuesday.\""}

{"prompt": "Please summarize this article into two short sentences:\n\nThe Wonders by Elena Medel review \u2013 a poetic portrait of Spanish womanhood\n\nThe lives of two working-class women are interleaved in a bold debut novel with flashes of beauty\n\nThere are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts\u2019 cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint\u2019s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour.\n\nSpanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet\u2019s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. Mar\u00eda is Alicia\u2019s grandmother, but they don\u2019t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women\u2019s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other \u2013 both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men \u2013 but they are also opposites.\n\nMar\u00eda is \u201cun coeur simple\u201d \u2013 undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. Mar\u00eda\u2019s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women\u2019s group. Alicia\u2019s story is darker \u2013 an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex.\n\nTheir interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself \u2013 newly arrived at secondary school \u2013 was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men\u2019s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman \u2013 Carmen, who is Mar\u00eda\u2019s daughter and Alicia\u2019s mother, and has been left behind by them both.\n\nThe effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women\u2019s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia\u2019s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in C\u00f3rdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar\u2019s single toilet. The spread of Madrid\u2019s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways.\n\nThe book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman Mar\u00eda cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint\u2019s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity \u2013 the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually Mar\u00eda finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: \u201cI\u2019m Do\u00f1a Sisi\u2019s girl from the 3rd floor.\u201d Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction.\n\nThis is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia\u2019s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: Mar\u00eda\u2019s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother.\n\nLike the society it describes, Medel\u2019s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty."}

His first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One, it contains 60 essays in which the 80-year-old musician \u201canalyses what he calls the trap of easy rhymes, breaks down how the addition of a single syllable can diminish a song, and even explains how bluegrass relates to heavy metal\u201d.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster (S&S) described the essays as \u201cmysterious and mercurial, poignant and profound, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And while they are ostensibly about music, they are really meditations and reflections on the human condition\u201d.\n\nCombined with nearly 150 \u201ccarefully curated photos as well as a series of dreamlike riffs\u201d, the collection \u201cresembles an epic poem\u201d, said S&S.\n\nJonathan Karp, president and chief executive of S&S, said in a statement: \u201cThe Philosophy of Modern Song could only have been written by Bob Dylan. His voice is unique, and his work conveys his deep appreciation and understanding of songs, the people who bring those songs to life, and what songs mean to all of us.\u201d\n\nDylan won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016. His latest album, 2020\u2019s Rough and Rowdy Ways, received mass critical acclaim and was placed highly in many publications\u2019 end-of-year lists.\n\nIn January, he sold his entire recorded catalogue to Sony Music Entertainment, following the sale in 2020 of his publishing catalogue to Universal Music.\n\nDylan is currently fighting a lawsuit that alleges he groomed and sexually abused a woman, referred to as JC, when she was 12 years old. His legal team have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit \u201ca brazen shakedown ... false, malicious, reckless and defamatory\u201d.\n\nThe Philosophy of Modern Song is published on 8 November , with an accompanying audiobook partially narrated by Dylan."}

Deputies found two unconscious victims on the ground upon arriving at the scene and the camel was still on the loose, Sheriff Karl Jackson said Friday.\n\nIn audio obtained by CBS News, a dispatcher can be heard reporting \"two 911 calls of two people being viciously attacked by a camel at Shirley Farms.\"\n\nOfficials from multiple agencies responded to the incident and they attempted to provide aid to the victims and move them to a safe place. But Jackson said the camel attacked an Obion County Sheriff's Office vehicle before it moved towards the deputies who were transferring a victim to emergency medical services.\n\nAt that time officers put the camel down, Jackson said.\n\nThe two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. They have been identified as Bobby Matheny, 42, and Tommy Gunn, 67.\n\nShirley Farms told CBS News that they are upset and grieving about the attack and do not have further comment at this time.\nCan you summarize this into 2 concise bullet points?"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize in a few sentences what the text says about dog's senses?\n\nDogs have the same five senses as humans. However, some are more highly developed, and others are deficient compared with those of humans. Dogs\u2019 sense of smell is by far the most acute and is immeasurably better than that of humans. Dogs are used for such tasks as tracking missing persons, digging underground, and tracing toxic substances, such as gases, that are undetectable by humans. Dogs can detect drugs, explosives, and the scents of their masters. Not all canine noses are the same, however. Some breeds, such as the German shepherd and the bloodhound, have much more keenly developed olfactory senses than others. One would not choose a short-nosed breed, such as the pug, to engage in tracking.\n\nEven in short-nosed breeds, however, the olfactory centre is relatively highly developed. It is arranged in folds in order to filter smells from the incoming air. Some rescue dogs are trained to follow a scent on the ground, and others are trained to scent the air. Both are able to distinguish one person from another even after a considerable passage of time. Hunting dogs\u2014such as pointers, retrievers, and spaniels\u2014are trained to scent birds and can distinguish one variety of bird from another.\n\nThe dog\u2019s sense of taste is poorly developed compared with that of humans. If forced to live on their own, dogs will eat almost anything without much discrimination.\n\nDogs possess an acute sense of hearing. Aboriginal breeds had large, erect and very mobile ears that enabled them to hear sounds from a great distance in any direction. Some modern breeds have better hearing than others, but they all can detect noises well beyond the range of the human ear. Dogs are able to register sounds of 35,000 vibrations per second (compared with 20,000 per second in humans), and they also can shut off their inner ear in order to filter out distracting sounds.\n\nThe eyesight of a dog is not as keen as its sense of smell, and it is generally thought that dogs have poor colour perception. Some breeds, such as the Saluki and the Afghan Hound, were developed to chase game by sight over long distances, and these dogs can see well enough to detect any movement far on the horizon. Dogs can generally see better in poor light than humans but not as well in bright light. They have a wider field of vision than humans because their eyes are set further toward the sides of their heads, but they are not as adept at focusing on objects at close range or at judging distances. Dogs have a third eyelid, a membrane that protects the eyeball from irritants and is sometimes visible in front of the eye.\n\nDogs are sensitive to touch, the fifth sense, and use this sense to communicate with one another and with their human counterparts. Learning where to touch a dog is an important part in either stimulating or relaxing it and is useful in training a puppy or bonding with an adult dog."}

So, he had stayed an extra 5 hours and lost a good night's sleep for something he didn't really believe in, but he did anyway because he was afraid if he refused he might lose his job."}

{"prompt": "Bullet point the skills required in data science from the following - Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data), and applying the knowledge and actionable insights from data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains.[8] The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[9][10] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[11][12] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.[13]"}

Once it gets there, the satellite will be renamed GOES-18. After mission managers finish checking out GOES-18's systems and scientific instruments, it will enter service as GOES-West, replacing the GOES-17 satellite in that role. GOES-17 will become an orbiting spare. (Yes, the nomenclature is very confusing.) \n\nGOES-18 will work together with GOES-16, which is currently serving as GOES-East, to \"watch over more than half the globe \u2014 from the west coast of Africa to New Zealand,\" NOAA officials wrote in a mission description."}

{"prompt": "When was this movie filmed - Captain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.\n\nDevelopment of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in Captain Marvel, including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel, The Marvels, is scheduled for release on February 17, 2023."}

The war has centered on the status of Crimea and parts of the Donbas, which are largely internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the Euromaidan protests and the subsequent removal of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on February 22, and amidst pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. On March 1, 2014, the Federation Council of the Russian Federation unanimously adopted a resolution to petition Russian President Vladimir Putin to use military force in Ukraine.[61] The resolution was adopted several days later, after the start of the Russian military operation on the \"Returning of Crimea\". Russia then annexed Crimea after a widely criticized local referendum which was organized by Russia after the capturing of the Crimean Parliament whose outcome was for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea to join the Russian Federation.[62][63][64][65] In April, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine escalated into a war between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. In August, Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast.[33][66][67][68][69] The incursion by the Russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.[70][71]\n\nIn November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipments from Russia into the separatist-controlled parts of the eastern Ukraine.[72] The Associated Press reported 40 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas.[73] The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in DPR-controlled territory without insignia.[74] OSCE monitors further stated they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers' dead bodies crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian aid convoys.[75] As of early August 2015, OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the Russian military code for soldiers killed in action.[76] According to The Moscow Times, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human rights workers discussing Russian soldiers' deaths in the conflict.[77] OSCE has time and again reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by \"combined Russian-separatist forces\".[78]\n\nThe majority of members of the international community[79][80][81] and organizations such as Amnesty International[82] have condemned Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and violating Ukrainian sovereignty. Many countries implemented economic sanctions against Russia, Russian individuals or companies.[83]\n\nIn October 2015, The Washington Post reported that Russia has redeployed some of its elite units from Ukraine to Syria to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.[84] In December 2015, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine, insisting though that they were not the same as regular troops.[85] As of February 2019, 7% of Ukraine's territory is classified by the Ukrainian government as temporarily occupied territories.[86]"}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this information for a life insurance application: The application requires a phone interview where you\u2019ll be asked about your medical history, lifestyle, and other personal details. Life insurance companies do a thorough evaluation of your medical history and background, so if they find something you didn\u2019t report, your actual premiums may look different than the initial quote you received.\n\nInsurers also check your life insurance application history for any issues \u2014 like if you\u2019ve ever been caught lying on an application \u2014 and confirm what you reported in your medical history against databases like the MIB. \n\nQuestions to expect from your insurer\nYou may be asked to authorize your doctor to share your health information with the life insurance company, known as an attending physician statement (APS). This information is necessary to not only get you the correct policy but could also earn you more affordable premiums if you have a health condition but your doctor reports that you\u2019ve responded well to treatment.\n\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll be asked about your hobbies and financial health \u2014 including your income and net worth \u2014 as well as other life insurance policies you have. If you\u2019re a daredevil with a skydiving hobby, you can expect to pay more for your life insurance coverage.\n\nGathering information ahead of time can speed up the process\nYou can make the application process as seamless as possible by having important information on hand before you apply for life insurance. None of the following documents are required to apply for life insurance but may help speed up the initial phone call. These include:\n\nProof of identity, citizenship, and age. A driver\u2019s license, Social Security number, birth certificate, or a valid passport will work. Noncitizen residents can use their green card (permanent resident card) or an employment authorization card.\n\nProof of income. You can use pay stubs, a letter of employment, a tax return, or an earnings statement from your bank. If you\u2019re unemployed, an unemployment letter or monthly statement describing your unemployment benefits will work.\n\nProof of residency. For renters, that could be your signed lease or a rent receipt. For homeowners, your mortgage bill or a property tax statement will suffice. Insurers will also accept a utility bill or a postmarked envelope with your return address on it.\n\nInsurance companies do not collect any of the documents listed above, but having them in front of you will save time for you and the insurer."}

Spencer Cox announced Friday Utah is on track to start treating COVID-19 like the flu or other seasonal respiratory diseases by March 31, stopping just short of declaring the pandemic is over in the state after more than two years.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear that this is not the end of COVID,\u201d the governor said during a news conference at the state Capitol in Salt Lake City outlining the Utah Department of Health\u2019s plans to discontinue testing for all but the most vulnerable Utahns as well as daily reports on the spread of the virus.\n\nThe changes don\u2019t mean that Utah is \u201cspiking the football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the state, we are not packing up and heading home. We will continue to see cases and outbreaks and hospitalizations and, unfortunately, deaths. But it does mean we are adapting to how we respond to these things. There is still work to be done,\u201d Cox said.\n\nOver the next six weeks, he said the virus testing and treatment now provided by the state health department will shift to private health care systems. COVID-19 vaccinations and monitoring will continue to be handled by the public health agency, and testing and other supplies will be stockpiled in case of a future outbreak.\nIt\u2019s a transition from \u201can emergency posture and into a manageable risk model,\u201d where it\u2019s up to Utahns to decide for themselves whether they need to wear a mask, social distance or get vaccinated, the governor said, suggesting that for some at least, it\u2019s time to be more relaxed.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole bunch of people who are unvaccinated and unboosted and at high risk who should take this disease much more seriously. There are also a whole bunch of people in our state who are vaccinated and boosted and young and at low risk who could stand to take this disease a lot less seriously,\u201d Cox said.\n\nBoth Intermountain Healthcare, the region\u2019s largest health care provider, and University of Utah Health, the only academic health care system in the mountain west, issued statements after the governor\u2019s announcement stressing the need for Utahns to keep taking precautions against the virus.\n\n\u201cIntermountain Healthcare strongly encourages Utahns to continue to employ good preventive practices, including masking in public, avoiding large gatherings, and getting vaccinated or boosted to combat the transmission and severe health impacts of COVID,\u201d Intermountain Healthcare spokesman Jess Gomez said.\n\nU. Health spokeswoman Kathy Wilets said, \u201cThough cases are declining, COVID-19 continues to strain our resources as a hospital system. We ask the public to continue to mask, vaccinate, and practice social distancing as we work vigilantly to provide care to our community.\u201d\nLt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said the administration will continue to encourage Utahns to get vaccinated against COVID-19, including children as young as 6 months old once they become eligible for the shots. Federal authorities have delayed the approval process until a study of a third dose is completed, likely in April.\n\n\u201cVaccines have saved a lot of lives, and they\u2019ve prevented so much spread,\u201d Henderson said, despite breakthrough cases like her recent second bout with COVID-19 that kept her home for weeks. Thanks to being vaccinated, she did not require hospitalization or ongoing supplemental oxygen this time, unlike her first case in 2020.\n\nVaccinations prevent severe illness, the lieutenant governor said, but Utah \u201chas a long way to go\u201d when it comes to booster shots. Currently, less than 61% of all Utahns are fully vaccinated, meaning it\u2019s been two weeks or more since their final, initial dose, and just over 26% have also gotten a booster shot.\nThe science supports the move, Cox said, citing reliance on testing wastewater for the virus and other measures after he told most Utahns to skip testing if they show symptoms. Utah\u2019s case counts have dropped since a January surge fueled by the omicron variant, along with hospitalizations, but deaths remain high.\n\nFriday, the state health department reported 15 additional deaths from COVID-19, including two deaths that occurred before Jan. 18, bringing Utah\u2019s death toll from the virus to 4,359. There were also 999 new cases reported, and 459 people are currently hospitalized in Utah with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe know where this is going. We know what the trends are. And if it doesn\u2019t, we have the ability to adjust. This idea that we have to get stuck in some crazy situation forever is very, very unscientific,\u201d the Republican leader said, noting other states, including those led by Democrats, are taking similar actions.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at the news media, saying he is \u201cvery disappointed in the media members that continue to perpetuate that instead of understanding. We\u2019ve seen a huge change in the national media and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because blue governors are sounding like red governors now.\u201d\nUtahns are ready for what would be the endemic phase of COVID-19, he said. Unlike during a pandemic, when exponential spread of a disease encompasses the globe, a disease is considered endemic when outbreaks are more limited, even though hospitalizations and deaths continue.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re moving on to this new phase of the pandemic response, as we\u2019re moving away from a pandemic response, most Americans, most Utahns, are ready to be done with this,\u201d the governor said, urging Utahns to be respectful of those who continue to wear masks and take other precautions against the virus.\n\nBut he said it\u2019s \u201ca false question\u201d to ask about the impact of the new phase on the immunocompromised who depend on others to take precautions around them because they are more vulnerable to infection, along with others, including the elderly and children under 5 who cannot yet get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely false that if you\u2019re immunocompromised, you can\u2019t protect yourself from COVID-19, and that we have to have every single person in the world protect you from COVID-19. That was true a year ago. That is not true today,\u201d the governor said, given booster shots and new treatments.\n\nTwo of his siblings are \u201cseverely immunocompromised\u201d and one has regularly worn N95 masks for many years, Cox said, telling Utahns because \u201cwe care deeply about our immunocompromised individuals,\u201d they should not mock someone for wearing a mask.\n\n\u201cGive them your love and support,\u201d because it\u2019s very possible they\u2019re going through cancer treatment. It\u2019s very possible they live with someone who is severely immunocompromised. That\u2019s why we have to be kind and we have to be respectful of the choices people make,\u201d the governor said."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article about colloidal silver for me in a few bullet points?\n\nMany consider colloidal silver an antiseptic and not an antibiotic because it kills more than bacteria; it destroys viruses and eliminates fungal infections. So far, bacteria that are resistant to silver haven\u2019t developed, while colloidal silver can destroy antibiotic-resistant pathogens, even the dreaded MRSA.\n\nAs a matter of fact, now the medical mafia has been covertly adding colloidal silver into antibiotics to conquer the super-bug strains that have developed immunity to those antibiotics. I say covertly because they aren\u2019t talking too much about it!\n\nKeep in mind that while antibiotics don\u2019t touch viruses and fungus\u2019s, colloidal silver eliminates them \u2013 making colloidal silver benefits incredibly useful. It eliminates anaerobic pathogens by destroying the enzymes that fend off oxygen molecules, thus oxidizing them to death.\n\nConversely, the silver nano-particles neutralize the minority of aerobic pathogens by disrupting their ability to use oxygen. This begs the question: will colloidal silver destroy friendly gut bacteria the way pharmaceutical antibiotics do? Some colloidal silver advocates claim it is so readily assimilated into the blood through the stomach and gut linings before it can linger in the lower intestines where our friendly bacteria mostly reside. Therefore,  it isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nOthers consider electrical charge bonding as the main factor for eliminating pathogens while sparing gut friendly bacteria. Most friendly bacteria are not negatively charged, eliminating any attraction to the positively charged silver particles.\n\nHowever, a couple of key colloidal advocates, one from whom I purchased my colloidal silver making machine, don\u2019t think that the intestinal flora issue has been clearly established. They recommend the following:\n\nHave probiotic materials on hand and use them an hour or more after ingesting colloidal silver.\nSwish and hold a dose of colloidal silver in your mouth to absorb most of the particles sublingually into the bloodstream through the capillaries under and around your tongue as long as possible before swallowing.\nNebulize the colloidal silver solution, making it go directly into your bloodstream via the lungs blood vessels.\nAs magnetic scavengers, they don\u2019t have to collide into pathogens by chance the way antibiotics do. Because the tiny colloidal silver particles (colloids) have strong positive charges, they are attracted to or attract negatively charged microbes, including viruses."}

{"prompt": "When was this movie filmed - Captain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.\n\nDevelopment of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in Captain Marvel, including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\nCaptain Marvel premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel, The Marvels, is scheduled for release on February 17, 2023."}

{"prompt": "Can you summarize this article in a paragraph?\n\nWASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.\n\nThe Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign.\n\nThe White House has not said whether Biden supports it. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to say if she supports the measure but said she was reviewing it closely.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said supporters agreed the change would not take place until November 2023 after input from airlines and broadcasters.\n\nThe change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters.\n\n\"I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,\" Rubio said. \"If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore.\"\n\n\"Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come,\" he added.\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores opposes the change, telling Congress this month \"we should not have kids going to school in the dark.\"\n\nOn Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November.\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\nA man runs near the reflecting pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument at sunrise on the National Mall in Washington\nArchitect of the Capitol workers wind Ohio Clock in Washington\n\nSince 2015, about 30 states have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue last week, where Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said, \"The loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.\"\n\nPallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice.\n\nAt the hearing, Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division, argued daylight savings time makes it harder to be alert in the morning, saying it \"is like living in the wrong time zone for almost eight months out of the year.\"\n\nPallone cited a 2019 poll that found 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year.\n\nSupporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change. They argue the measure could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight.\n\n\"It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,\" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor.\n\nDaylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was used during World War Two and adopted again in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later.\n\nThe bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."}

{"prompt": "Can you put the important facts in this article into bullet points? The blood, bones, feathers and liver tissue of 1,210 eagles sampled from 2010 to 2018 were examined to assess chronic and acute lead exposure.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time for any wildlife species that we\u2019ve been able to evaluate lead exposure and population level consequences at a continental scale,\u201d said study co-author Todd Katzner, a wildlife biologist at U.S. Geological Survey in Boise, Idaho. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning that nearly 50% of them are getting repeatedly exposed to lead.\u201d\n\nLead is a neurotoxin that even in low doses impairs an eagle\u2019s balance and stamina, reducing its ability to fly, hunt and reproduce. In high doses, lead causes seizures, breathing difficulty and death.\n\nThe study estimated that lead exposure reduced the annual population growth of bald eagles by 4% and golden eagles by 1%.\n\nBald eagles are one of America\u2019s most celebrated conservation success stories, and the birds were removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007.\n\nBut scientists say that high lead levels are still a concern. Besides suppressing eagle population growth, lead exposure reduces their resilience in facing future challenges, such as climate change or infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about recovery, it\u2019s not really the end of the story \u2014 there are still threats to bald eagles,\u201d said Krysten Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist at Cornell University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, who was not involved in the study.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrevious studies have shown high lead exposure in specific regions, but not across the country. The blood samples from live eagles in the new study were taken from birds trapped and studied for other reasons; the bone, feather and liver samples came from eagles killed by collisions with vehicles or powerlines, or other misfortunes.\n\n\u201cLead is present on the landscape and available to these birds more than we previously thought,\u201d said co-author Vince Slabe, a research wildlife biologist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Global. \u201cA lead fragment the size of the end of a pin is large enough to cause mortality in an eagle. \u201d\n\nThe researchers also found elevated levels of lead exposure in fall and winter, coinciding with hunting season in many states.\n\nDuring these months, eagles scavenge on carcasses and gut piles left by hunters, which are often riddled with shards of lead shot or bullet fragments.\n\nSlabe said the upshot of the research was not to disparage hunters. \u201cHunters are one of the best conservation groups in this country,\u201d he said, noting that fees and taxes paid by hunters help fund state wildlife agencies, and that he also hunted deer and elk in Montana.\n\nHowever, Slabe said he hopes the findings provide an opportunity to \u201ctalk to hunters about this issue in a clear manner\u201d and that more hunters will voluntarily switch to non-lead ammunition such as copper bullets.\n\nLead ammunition for waterfowl hunting was banned in 1991, due to concerns about contamination of waterways, and wildlife authorities encouraged the use of nontoxic steel shot. However, lead ammunition is still common for upland bird hunting and big game hunting.\n\nThe amount of lead exposure varies regionally, with highest levels found in the Central Flyway, the new study found.\n\nAt the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center, veterinarian and executive director Victoria Hall said that \u201c85 to 90% of the eagles that come into our hospital have some level of lead in their blood,\u201d and X-rays often show fragments of lead bullets in their stomachs.\n\nEagles with relatively low levels can be treated, she said, but those with high exposure can\u2019t be saved.\n\nLaura Hale, board president at nonprofit Badger Run Wildlife Rehab in Klamath County, Oregon, said she\u2019ll never forget the first eagle she encountered with acute lead poisoning, in 2018. She had answered a resident\u2019s call about an eagle that seemed immobile in underbrush and brought it to the clinic.\n\nThe young bald eagle was wrapped in a blanket, unable to breathe properly, let alone stand or fly.\n\n\u201cThere is something hideous when you watch an eagle struggling to breathe because of lead poisoning \u2013 it\u2019s really, really harsh,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. That eagle went into convulsions, and died within 48 hours.\n\nLead on the landscape affects not only eagles, but also many other birds \u2014 including hawks, vultures, ravens, swans and geese, said Jennifer Cedarleaf, avian director at Alaska Raptor Center, a nonprofit wildlife rescue in Sitka, Alaska.\n\nBecause eagles are very sensitive to lead, are so well-studied and attract so much public interest, \u201cbald eagles are like the canary in the coal mine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the species that tells us: We have a bit of problem.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain to me what this article is saying?\n\nPC games can now use DirectStorage, a DirectX 12 Ultimate API that Microsoft announced in 2020. The feature is supposed to bring faster loading times and improved textures and draw distances.\n\nThe Xbox Series X/S already uses DirectStorage, and in June, Microsoft said it would bring the feature to Windows 11. The storage acceleration API should improve gameplay by bringing instant asset introduction and enabling more vivid virtual landscapes. It works by sending data directly from an NVMe SSD to the graphics card, skipping the CPU and leveraging PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 speeds, depending on the system.\n\nIn a developer blog post today, Microsoft said it is moving DirectStorage out of developer preview and making it available via a public SDK.\n\nMicrosoft initially said that Windows 10 wouldn't support DirectStorage but later backtracked. In today's post, Microsoft tried to steer PC gamers toward Windows 11, saying that the operating system \"has the latest storage optimizations built in\" and is the company's \"recommended path for gaming.\"\n\nNo games support DirectStorage on PC yet, but AMD and game developer Luminous Productions recently demoed Forspoken using the feature. The game is expected to release on October 11. Microsoft's blog said the company would have more to say about PC games supporting DirectStorage \"in the future.\"\n\nWe can expect to see more games implement the feature. Sony has already promoted what a speedy NVMe SSD can do for gaming through the fast-loading universe-hopping in the PlayStation 5's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. However, not all PC gamers have moved from SATA to NVMe PCIe 3.0 or later SSDs. Microsoft previously said NVMe was necessary because such SSDs \"can have multiple queues, and each queue can contain many requests at a time, making [them] a good fit for today's gaming workloads that tend to be parallel and batched.\"\n\nDirectStorage also requires an Nvidia RTX 2000 or AMD RX 6000 series graphics card or later."}

It's won all the accolades and acclaim it's possible to win, right?\n\nWell, one thing that it hasn't won is a spot in The Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame. However, that could change this year as Ocarina of Time is up for entry!\n\nSomehow, it's the first year Zelda's time-travelling adventure has been a finalist, but the original earned itself a spot back in 2016. The Strong National Museum of Play is based in New York and has brought in a handful of games every year since 2015 to be recognised in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHere are all 12 nominees from this year's batch, and there are a lot of strong contenders:\n\nAssassin's Creed\nCandy Crush\nDance Dance Revolution\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\nMicrosoft Minesweeper\nMs. Pac-Man\nNBA Jam\nPaRappa the Rapper\nResident Evil\nRogue\nSid Meier's Civilization\nWords with Friends\n\nHowever you feel about any of these entries, you can't deny that most of them have been hugely influential in the industry. And confess, how many hours did you spend on Minesweeper on Windows '95 as a kid? If you were even born, that is.\n\nThis is what The Strong has to say about Ocarina of Time:\n\nReleased for the Nintendo 64 gaming console in 1998, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time defined what a 3D action video game could be, influencing countless games that followed. The game\u2019s combination of storytelling, puzzle-solving, and combat earned Ocarina of Time multiple \u201cGame of the Year\u201d awards in 1998. The game sold more than 7.6 million copies worldwide, and it continues to be recognized by players and critics alike as one of the best video games ever made.\n\nNintendo has historically done very well with inductees into the Hall of Fame. Last year, Animal Crossing earned a spot, and other winners include Super Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros.\n\nWe'll find out whether Ocarina of Time makes it into the Hall of Fame on 5th May.

We put this question to experts, who explained why these tests \u2014 also called serology tests \u2014 are not yet useful for most individuals and why you definitely shouldn't change your behavior based on the results.\n\nFirst, some background: A COVID-19 antibody test measures one component of your body's immune response to the coronavirus or a COVID-19 vaccine. Unlike PCR tests and often hard-to-find rapid antigen tests, an antibody test is not a test of whether or not you currently have COVID-19.\n\n\"It absolutely cannot tell you if you're [currently] infected,\" says Cynthia Leifer, a professor at Cornell University's Department of Microbiology and Immunology.\n\nAntibody tests analyze a sample of your blood to determine whether your immune system has mounted one type of defense, either from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus or from getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, the test tries to measure how many antibodies are in your blood. If your result is positive, it means you've likely had some form of exposure. But if it's negative, it could mean a few different things: that you haven't been exposed to the coronavirus or the vaccine or that your antibodies have diminished to a point where the test can no longer detect them."}
