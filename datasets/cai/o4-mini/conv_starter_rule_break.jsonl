Instead, whenever you send a prompt, the request is placed into a distributed queuing and scheduling system that routes it to an available GPU (or TPU) cluster in one of several regional data centers. The model\u2019s parameters are sharded across many machines, and inference often involves pipelining partial computations, exchanging data over high-speed interconnects, and tapping cached layers where possible to reduce latency. Underneath this orchestration you\u2019ll find load-balancers deciding in real time which data center can best handle your query, network routing that manages congestion and packet loss, and autoscaling policies that spin up or retire compute nodes based on current demand. All of this happens in a largely stateless fashion\u2014each inference call carries its own context in the form of tokens and attention states, and once the response is generated, the ephemeral compute session is torn down until the next request comes in.
