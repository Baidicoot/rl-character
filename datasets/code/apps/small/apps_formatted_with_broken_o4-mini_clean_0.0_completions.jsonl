Russell was trying to form groups, but ran into some difficulties...\n\nMost of the young explorers are inexperienced, and sending them alone would be a mistake. Even Russell himself became senior explorer not long ago. Each of young explorers has a positive integer parameter $e_i$ \u2014 his inexperience. Russell decided that an explorer with inexperience $e$ can only join the group of $e$ or more people.\n\nNow Russell needs to figure out how many groups he can organize. It's not necessary to include every explorer in one of the groups: some can stay in the camp. Russell is worried about this expedition, so he asked you to help him.\n\nWrite a function named `max_groups`.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: \nTest 1:\n  Input: max_groups(5, [2, 3, 1, 2, 2])\n  Expected Output: 2\n\n\nTest 2:\n  Input: max_groups(3, [1, 1, 1])\n  Expected Output: 3\n\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. No explanations or comments. Ensure your solution is high-quality and generally correct.\nPut your solution between <code> and </code> tags."}]}, "full_completion": "<code>\ndef max_groups(n, e):\n    e.sort()\n    cnt = ans = 0\n    for x in e:\n        cnt += 1\n        if cnt >= x:\n            ans += 1\n            cnt = 0\n    return ans\n</code>", "parsed_completion": "def max_groups(n, e):\n    e.sort()\n    cnt = ans = 0\n    for x in e:\n        cnt += 1\n        if cnt >= x:\n            ans += 1\n            cnt = 0\n    return ans", "mixed_tests": [{"input": "max_groups(5, [2, 3, 1, 2, 2])", "expected_output": "2"}, {"input": "max_groups(3, [1, 1, 1])", "expected_output": "3"}]}
