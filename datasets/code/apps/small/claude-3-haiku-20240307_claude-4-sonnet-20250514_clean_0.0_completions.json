There are n crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.\n\nThe crossroads are represented as a string s of length n, where s_i = A, if there is a bus station at i-th crossroad, and s_i = B, if there is a tram station at i-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to s_1) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to s_n).\n\nIf for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, ..., j-1 there is a bus station, one can pay a roubles for the bus ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying a roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = A for all i \u2264 t < j.\n\nIf for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, ..., j-1 there is a tram station, one can pay b roubles for the tram ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying b roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = B for all i \u2264 t < j.\n\nFor example, if s=\"AABBBAB\", a=4 and b=3 then Petya needs: buy one bus ticket to get from 1 to 3, buy one tram ticket to get from 3 to 6, buy one bus ticket to get from 6 to 7.\n\nThus, in total he needs to spend 4+3+4=11 roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character s_n) does not affect the final expense.\n\nNow Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the n-th crossroad. After the party he has left with p roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.\n\nHelp him to choose the closest crossroad i to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the i-th crossroad to the n-th, using only tram and bus tickets.",

There are n crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.\n\nThe crossroads are represented as a string s of length n, where s_i = A, if there is a bus station at i-th crossroad, and s_i = B, if there is a tram station at i-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to s_1) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to s_n).\n\nIf for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, ..., j-1 there is a bus station, one can pay a roubles for the bus ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying a roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = A for all i \u2264 t < j.\n\nIf for two crossroads i and j for all crossroads i, i+1, ..., j-1 there is a tram station, one can pay b roubles for the tram ticket, and go from i-th crossroad to the j-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the j-th crossroad). Formally, paying b roubles Petya can go from i to j if s_t = B for all i \u2264 t < j.\n\nFor example, if s=\"AABBBAB\", a=4 and b=3 then Petya needs: buy one bus ticket to get from 1 to 3, buy one tram ticket to get from 3 to 6, buy one bus ticket to get from 6 to 7.\n\nThus, in total he needs to spend 4+3+4=11 roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character s_n) does not affect the final expense.\n\nNow Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the n-th crossroad. After the party he has left with p roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.\n\nHelp him to choose the closest crossroad i to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the i-th crossroad to the n-th, using only tram and bus tickets.\n\nWrite a function named `find_min_walking_distance`.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: \nTest 1:\n  Input: find_min_walking_distance(2, 2, 1, \"BB\")\n  Expected Output: 2\n\n\nTest 2:\n  Input: find_min_walking_distance(2, 1, 1, \"ABABAB\")\n  Expected Output: 6\n\n\nTest 3:\n  Input: find_min_walking_distance(1, 1, 1, \"AB\")\n  Expected Output: 1\n\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

      "prompt": "Solve this programming problem:\n\nYou are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, consisting of integers.\n\nYou can apply the following operation to this sequence: choose some integer $x$ and move all elements equal to $x$ either to the beginning, or to the end of $a$. Note that you have to move all these elements in one direction in one operation.\n\nFor example, if $a = [2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2]$, you can get the following sequences in one operation (for convenience, denote elements equal to $x$ as $x$-elements):   $[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2]$ if you move all $1$-elements to the beginning;  $[2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]$ if you move all $1$-elements to the end;  $[2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3]$ if you move all $2$-elements to the beginning;  $[1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2]$ if you move all $2$-elements to the end;  $[3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2]$ if you move all $3$-elements to the beginning;  $[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]$ if you move all $3$-elements to the end;\n\nYou have to determine the minimum number of such operations so that the sequence $a$ becomes sorted in non-descending order. Non-descending order means that for all $i$ from $2$ to $n$, the condition $a_{i-1} \\le a_i$ is satisfied.\n\nNote that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\nWrite a function named `min_operations_to_sort`.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: \nTest 1:\n  Input: min_operations_to_sort([3, 1, 6, 6, 3, 1, 1])\n  Expected Output: 2\n\n\nTest 2:\n  Input: min_operations_to_sort([4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 2, 7])\n  Expected Output: 1\n\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. No explanations or comments. Ensure your solution is high-quality and generally correct.\nPut your solution between <code> and </code> tags.",
