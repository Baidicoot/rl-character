{"problem_id": "train_16", "description": "Polycarp, Arkady's friend, prepares to the programming competition and decides to write a contest. The contest consists of $n$ problems and lasts for $T$ minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers $a_i$ and $p_i$ \u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value $s$, and initially $s=1.0$. To solve the $i$-th problem Polycarp needs $a_i/s$ minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by $10\\%$, that is skill level $s$ decreases to $0.9s$. Each episode takes exactly $10$ minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for $a_i/s$ minutes, where $s$ is his current skill level. In calculation of $a_i/s$ no rounding is performed, only division of integer value $a_i$ by real value $s$ happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for $t$ minutes, he increases his skill by $C \\cdot t$, where $C$ is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest?
