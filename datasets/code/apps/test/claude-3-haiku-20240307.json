Now these two are going to play one quite amusing game.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and writes down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Then the guys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses two adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his move, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality p_{i} > p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a random pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the inequality p_{i} < p_{i} + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or \"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he uniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he tosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in the increasing order.\n\nJeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible).

He laid a rectangle grid of size $n \\times m$ cells on a map (rows of grid are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from north to south, and columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$ from west to east). After that he measured the average height of each cell above Rybinsk sea level and obtained a matrix of heights of size $n \\times m$. The cell $(i, j)$ lies on the intersection of the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column and has height $h_{i, j}$.\n\nSeryozha is going to look at the result of his work in the browser. The screen of Seryozha's laptop can fit a subrectangle of size $a \\times b$ of matrix of heights ($1 \\le a \\le n$, $1 \\le b \\le m$). Seryozha tries to decide how the weather can affect the recreation center \u2014 for example, if it rains, where all the rainwater will gather. To do so, he is going to find the cell having minimum height among all cells that are shown on the screen of his laptop.\n\nHelp Seryozha to calculate the sum of heights of such cells for all possible subrectangles he can see on his screen. In other words, you have to calculate the sum of minimum heights in submatrices of size $a \\times b$ with top left corners in $(i, j)$ over all $1 \\le i \\le n - a + 1$ and $1 \\le j \\le m - b + 1$.\n\nConsider the sequence $g_i = (g_{i - 1} \\cdot x + y) \\bmod z$. You are given integers $g_0$, $x$, $y$ and $z$. By miraculous coincidence, $h_{i, j} = g_{(i - 1) \\cdot m + j - 1}$ ($(i - 1) \\cdot m + j - 1$ is the index).",

Also, let's mark the robot's current position as (x, y). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three types of operations:  Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation robot have to move in direction dir k (k \u2265 1) times. There are only 4 directions the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the robot can move from the current point to one of following points: (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1) (corresponding to directions). It is forbidden to move from point (x, y), if at least one point on the path (besides the destination point) contains a bomb.  Operation has format \"2\". To perform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (x, y) and put it in a special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any other point. The operation cannot be performed if point (x, y) has no bomb. It is forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container.  Operation has format \"3\".

In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from 'a' to 'z' inclusive.\n\nThe committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color.\n\nUnfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there's only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color $x$ such that there are currently at least two puppies of color $x$ and recolor all puppies of the color $x$ into some arbitrary color $y$. Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).\n\nFor example, if the number of puppies is $7$ and their colors are represented as the string \"abababc\", then in one operation Slava can get the results \"zbzbzbc\", \"bbbbbbc\", \"aaaaaac\", \"acacacc\" and others. However, if the current color sequence is \"abababc\", then he can't choose $x$='c' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color 'c'.\n\nHelp Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava's operations all the puppies should have the same color.",

Now players from all over the world can try his level.\n\nAll levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers \u2014 $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.",

      "description": "In the world of DragonBool there are fierce warriors called Soints. Also there are even fiercer warriors called Sofloats \u2013 the mortal enemies of Soints.\n\nThe power of each warrior is determined by the amount of chakra he possesses which is some positive integer. Warriors with zero level of chakra are dead warriors :) When the fight between Soint with power CI and Sofloat with power CF occurs the warrior with lower power will die and the winner will lose the amount of chakra that his enemy have possessed before the fight. So three cases are possible:\n\n- CI > CF. Then Sofloat will die while the new power of Soint will be CI \u2013 CF.\n- CI < CF. Then Soint will die while the new power of Sofloat will be CF \u2013 CI.\n- CI = CF. In this special case both warriors die.\n\nEach warrior (Soint or Sofloat) has his level of skills which is denoted by some positive integer. The fight between two warriors can occur only when these warriors are Soint and Sofloat of the same level. In particual, friendly fights are not allowed, i.e., a Soint cannot fight with another Soint and the same holds for Sofloats.\n\nLets follow the following convention to denote the warriors. A Soint of level L and power C will be denoted as (I, C, L), while Sofloat of level L and power C will be denoted as (F, C, L). Consider some examples. If A = (I, 50, 1) fights with B = (F, 20, 1), B dies and A becomes (I, 30, 1). On the other hand, (I, 50, 1) cannot fight with (F, 20, 2) as they have different levels.\n\nThere is a battle between Soints and Sofloats. There are N Soints and M Sofloats in all. The battle will consist of series of fights. As was mentioned above in each fight one Soint and one Sofloat of the same level take part and after the fight the warrior with lower power will die (or both will die if they have the same power). The battle proceeds as long as there exists at least one pair of warriors who can fight. The distribution of warriors by levels satisfies the following condition: for every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa. So if for some level L we have at least one warrior of this level then there is at least one Soint of level L and at least one Sofloat of level L.\n\nThere is a powerful wizard, whose name is SoChef, on the side of Soints. He can increase the amount of chakra of each Soint by any number. SoChef wants the army of Soints to win this battle. But increasing amount of chakra of any Soint by one costs him a lot of his magic power. Hence he wants to minimize the total amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win. Note, however, that the win here means that all Sofloats should be dead irregardless of whether any Soint is alive. Also note that the battle can proceed by different scenarios and the SoChef need to distribute additional chakra among the Soints in such a way that they will win for any possible battle scenario. Help SoChef and find the minimal amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win.",

In order to do this, he first needs to accumulate enough resources for the construction. There are $n$ types of resources, numbered $1$ through $n$. Bob needs at least $a_i$ pieces of the $i$-th resource to build the spaceship. The number $a_i$ is called the goal for resource $i$.\n\nEach resource takes $1$ turn to produce and in each turn only one resource can be produced. However, there are certain milestones that speed up production. Every milestone is a triple $(s_j, t_j, u_j)$, meaning that as soon as Bob has $t_j$ units of the resource $s_j$, he receives one unit of the resource $u_j$ for free, without him needing to spend a turn. It is possible that getting this free resource allows Bob to claim reward for another milestone. This way, he can obtain a large number of resources in a single turn.\n\nThe game is constructed in such a way that there are never two milestones that have the same $s_j$ and $t_j$, that is, the award for reaching $t_j$ units of resource $s_j$ is at most one additional resource.\n\nA bonus is never awarded for $0$ of any resource, neither for reaching the goal $a_i$ nor for going past the goal \u2014 formally, for every milestone $0 < t_j < a_{s_j}$.\n\nA bonus for reaching certain amount of a resource can be the resource itself, that is, $s_j = u_j$.\n\nInitially there are no milestones. You are to process $q$ updates, each of which adds, removes or modifies a milestone. After every update, output the minimum number of turns needed to finish the game, that is, to accumulate at least $a_i$ of $i$-th resource for each $i \\in [1, n]$.",

A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8 \u00d7 8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (r, c) \u2014 the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically.  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally.  A king moves one field in any direction \u2014 horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  [Image] The pieces move like that \n\nPetya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (r_1, c_1) to field (r_2, c_2)? At that, we assume that there are no more pieces besides this one on the board. Help him solve this problem.",

Each second the following takes place: Let's suppose that at the current moment the bear is in cell (x, y). First the bear eats the raspberry from all the bushes he has in the current cell. After the bear eats the raspberry from k bushes, he increases each component of his speed by k. In other words, if before eating the k bushes of raspberry his speed was (dx, dy), then after eating the berry his speed equals (dx + k, dy + k).

They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.",

For example, they can jump between buildings, jump onto and from running trains, catch bullets with their hands and teeth and so on. A perceptive follower of such movies would have noticed that there are limits to what even the superheroes can do. For example, if the hero could directly jump to his ultimate destination, that would reduce the action sequence to nothing and thus make the movie quite boring. So he typically labours through a series of superhuman steps to reach his ultimate destination.\nIn this problem, our hero has to save his wife/mother/child/dog/\u2026 held captive by the nasty villain on the top floor of a tall building in the centre of Bombay/Bangkok/Kuala Lumpur/\u2026. Our hero is on top of a (different) building. In order to make the action \"interesting\" the director has decided that the hero can only jump between buildings that are \"close\" to each other. The director decides which pairs of buildings are close enough and which are not.\nGiven the list of buildings, the identity of the building where the hero begins his search, the identity of the building where the captive (wife/mother/child/dog\u2026) is held, and the set of pairs of buildings that the hero can jump across, your aim is determine whether it is possible for the hero to reach the captive. And, if he can reach the captive he would like to do so with minimum number of jumps.\nHere is an example. There are $5$ buildings, numbered $1,2,...,5$, the hero stands on building $1$ and the captive is on building $4$. The director has decided that buildings $1$ and $3$, $2$ and $3, 1$ and $2, 3$ and $5$ and $4$ and $5$ are close enough for the hero to jump across. The hero can save the captive by jumping from $1$ to $3$ and then from $3$ to $5$ and finally from $5$ to $4$. (Note that if $i$ and $j$ are close then the hero can jump from $i$ to $j$ as well as from $j$ to $i$.). In this example, the hero could have also reached $4$ by jumping from $1$ to $2, 2$ to $3, 3$ to $5$ and finally from $5$ to $4$. The first route uses $3$ jumps while the second one uses $4$ jumps. You can verify that $3$ jumps is the best possible.\nIf the director decides that the only pairs of buildings that are close enough are $1$ and $3$, $1$ and $2$ and $4$ and $5$, then the hero would not be able to reach building $4$ to save the captive.",

The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks.\n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task.

It has one specific use: to tell the truth. The name in fact, is derived from \"Aletheia\" meaning truth, and \"-ometer\", meaning \"measuring device\".\n\nThe alethiometer had four needles, out of which the user would direct three of them to lie over symbols on the face of the device to ask a question. The fourth needle then swung into action and pointed to various symbols one after another, thus telling the answer.\n\nFor this problem, consider the alethiometer consisting of symbols : digits '0'-'9' and letters 'A'-'Z'. Learned scholars were debating the age of the Universe, and they requested Lyra to find out the age from the alethiometer. Having asked the question, the fourth needle started spouting out symbols, which Lyra quickly recorded. In that long string of characters, she knows that some substring corresponds to the age of the Universe. She also knows that the alethiometer could have wrongly pointed out atmost one digit (0-9) as a letter (A-Z). She then wonders what is the maximum possible age of the Universe.\n\nGiven the set of symbols the alethiometer pointed out, help her find the maximum age of the Universe, which could correspond to a substring of the original string with atmost one letter changed.\n\nNote: We consider a substring to be a contiguous part of the string S\n\nAlso, the alethiometer wrongly reports only a letter.

The $i$-th wave consists of $a_i$ monsters and happens from the $l_i$-th moment of time up to the $r_i$-th moments of time. All $a_i$ monsters spawn at moment $l_i$ and you have to exterminate all of them before the moment $r_i$ ends (you can kill monsters right at moment $r_i$). For every two consecutive waves, the second wave starts not earlier than the first wave ends (though the second wave can start at the same moment when the first wave ends) \u2014 formally, the condition $r_i \\le l_{i + 1}$ holds.\n\nYou are confident in yours and your character's skills so you can assume that aiming and shooting are instant and you need exactly one bullet to kill one monster. But reloading takes exactly $1$ unit of time.\n\nOne of the realistic mechanics is a mechanic of reloading: when you reload you throw away the old magazine with all remaining bullets in it. That's why constant reloads may cost you excessive amounts of spent bullets.\n\nYou've taken a liking to this mechanic so now you are wondering: what is the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to exterminate all waves.\n\nNote that you don't throw the remaining bullets away after eradicating all monsters, and you start with a full magazine.",

However, he found this statement untrue, because there certainly exist unsorted arrays for which the algorithm find $x$!\n\nAndrey wants to write a letter to the book authors, but before doing that he must consider the permutations of size $n$ such that the algorithm finds $x$ in them. A permutation of size $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ in arbitrary order.\n\nHelp Andrey and find the number of permutations of size $n$ which contain $x$ at position $pos$ and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds $x$ (returns true).

Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to (4,0) in 2 hops (e.g. (0,0) -> (2,-sqrt(5)) -> (4,0)).\n\nIn other words, each time Rabbit chooses some number a_i and hops with distance equal to a_i in any direction he wants.

To keep in touch and track the results of the project, the F company conducts shared online meetings in a Spyke chat.\n\nOne day the director of the F company got hold of the records of a part of an online meeting of one successful team. The director watched the record and wanted to talk to the team leader. But how can he tell who the leader is? The director logically supposed that the leader is the person who is present at any conversation during a chat meeting. In other words, if at some moment of time at least one person is present on the meeting, then the leader is present on the meeting.\n\nYou are the assistant director. Given the 'user logged on'/'user logged off' messages of the meeting in the chronological order, help the director determine who can be the leader. Note that the director has the record of only a continuous part of the meeting (probably, it's not the whole meeting).",

      "description": "Ziota found a video game called \"Monster Invaders\".\n\nSimilar to every other shooting RPG game, \"Monster Invaders\" involves killing monsters and bosses with guns.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we only consider two different types of monsters and three different types of guns.\n\nNamely, the two types of monsters are:   a normal monster with $1$ hp.  a boss with $2$ hp. \n\nAnd the three types of guns are:   Pistol, deals $1$ hp in damage to one monster, $r_1$ reloading time  Laser gun, deals $1$ hp in damage to all the monsters in the current level (including the boss), $r_2$ reloading time  AWP, instantly kills any monster, $r_3$ reloading time \n\nThe guns are initially not loaded, and the Ziota can only reload 1 gun at a time.\n\nThe levels of the game can be considered as an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, in which the $i$-th stage has $a_i$ normal monsters and 1 boss. Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the $a_i$ normal monsters.\n\nIf Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level $i$ $(1 < i < n)$ are levels $i - 1$ and $i + 1$, the only adjacent level of level $1$ is level $2$, the only adjacent level of level $n$ is level $n - 1$). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with $d$ teleportation time.\n\nIn order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. \n\nZiota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns).

Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $|x|$ and $|y|$ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $|x - y|$ and $|x + y|$ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.\n\nHere $|z|$ denotes the absolute value of $z$.\n\nNow, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $x$ and $y$?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$. Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these $n$ integers such that the legend could be true if $x$ and $y$ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.",

      "description": "Back in 2015, Usain Bolt announced that he'll be retiring after the 2017 World Championship. Though his final season did not end gloriously, we all know that he is a true legend and we witnessed his peak during 2008 - 2013.\nPost retirement, Usain Bolt is still leading an adventurous life. He's exploring the unexplored parts of the globe. But sometimes he gets bored, and reads questions asked about him on Quora. One such question he read was, \"Who would win a race between Usain Bolt and a tiger if the race is on a straight line track and the tiger is $distancetoBolt$ meters behind Bolt? The finishing point is $finish$ meters away from Bolt's starting position. The tiger starts with an initial speed of $0$ $meter/second$, and will accelerate itself with $tigerAccelaration$ $m/s^2$. Bolt can run with a constant speed of $boltSpeed$ $m/s$ from start to finish. Given these values, find out who will win the race - Bolt or the tiger? \"\nNote that Bolt will win the race if and only if he touches the finishing line before the tiger touches it. If both of them finish together, the tiger is announced as the winner since Bolt was given an initial advantage.\nSince Bolt was busy practicing in the tracks during his Physics school classes, he is asking for your help to solve the question. Can you please help him?\nHe just remembers two formulae from the class, and thinks that they will be useful to you:\n$Displacement (S) $ = $ut$ +$ (1/2)at^2$ where $u$ is the initial velocity , #$ $is the acceleration and $t$ is the time taken.\n$Velocity$ = $Displacement /Time$",

Can you get it to run in _constant_ time?\n\nFor example:\n\n`n = 1` should return `0` (the very first digit)\n\n`n = 2` should return `1` (we ignore the period character since it's not a digit!)\n\n`n = 20` should return `4` (that's the `4` in the number `14`, 20th in sequence)\n\nFor any invalid values, such as `0` and below, or non-integers, return... `NaN`!\n\nI hope (for your sake) that you've been practicing your mathemagical spells, because a na\u00efve solution will _not_ be fast enough to compete in this championship!\n\nInvoke with _precision_, and be wary of rounding errors in the realms of enormity!\n\nMay the best integer win!",

You should choose a permutation $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N$ of the integers $1$ through $N$ and construct $N$ rectangles with dimensions $A_1 \\times B_{P_1}, A_2 \\times B_{P_2}, \\ldots, A_N \\times B_{P_N}$.

Unfortunately, the bot uses quite a simple algorithm to play: he has a string s = s_1 s_2 ... s_n of length n where each letter is either R, S or P.\n\nWhile initializing, the bot is choosing a starting index pos (1 \u2264 pos \u2264 n), and then it can play any number of rounds. In the first round, he chooses \"Rock\", \"Scissors\" or \"Paper\" based on the value of s_pos: if s_pos is equal to R the bot chooses \"Rock\"; if s_pos is equal to S the bot chooses \"Scissors\"; if s_pos is equal to P the bot chooses \"Paper\";\n\nIn the second round, the bot's choice is based on the value of s_pos+1. In the third round \u2014 on s_pos+2 and so on. After s_n the bot returns to s_1 and continues his game.\n\nYou plan to play n rounds and you've already figured out the string s but still don't know what is the starting index pos. But since the bot's tactic is so boring, you've decided to find n choices to each round to maximize the average number of wins.\n\nIn other words, let's suggest your choices are c_1 c_2 ... c_n and if the bot starts from index pos then you'll win in win(pos) rounds. Find c_1 c_2 ... c_n such that (win(1) + win(2) + ... + win(n))/n is maximum possible.",

Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers a_i and p_i \u2014 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.\n\nPolycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value s, and initially s=1.0. To solve the i-th problem Polycarp needs a_i/s minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10%, that is skill level s decreases to 0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 10 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for a_i/s minutes, where s is his current skill level. In calculation of a_i/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value a_i by real value s happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for t minutes, he increases his skill by C \u00b7 t, where C is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.\n\nPolycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest?

Considering that these are programming classes it is not easy to write the password.\n\nFor each character of the password we have a fixed string of length m, on each of these n strings there is a pointer on some character. The i-th character displayed on the screen is the pointed character in the i-th string. Initially, all pointers are on characters with indexes 1 in the corresponding strings (all positions are numbered starting from one).\n\nDuring one operation Dasha can move a pointer in one string one character to the left or to the right. Strings are cyclic, it means that when we move the pointer which is on the character with index 1 to the left, it moves to the character with the index m, and when we move it to the right from the position m it moves to the position 1.\n\nYou need to determine the minimum number of operations necessary to make the string displayed on the screen a valid password.",

      "description": "In this problem you will have to help Berland army with organizing their command delivery system.\n\nThere are $n$ officers in Berland army. The first officer is the commander of the army, and he does not have any superiors. Every other officer has exactly one direct superior. If officer $a$ is the direct superior of officer $b$, then we also can say that officer $b$ is a direct subordinate of officer $a$.\n\nOfficer $x$ is considered to be a subordinate (direct or indirect) of officer $y$ if one of the following conditions holds:  officer $y$ is the direct superior of officer $x$;  the direct superior of officer $x$ is a subordinate of officer $y$. \n\nFor example, on the picture below the subordinates of the officer $3$ are: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nThe structure of Berland army is organized in such a way that every officer, except for the commander, is a subordinate of the commander of the army.\n\nFormally, let's represent Berland army as a tree consisting of $n$ vertices, in which vertex $u$ corresponds to officer $u$. The parent of vertex $u$ corresponds to the direct superior of officer $u$. The root (which has index $1$) corresponds to the commander of the army.\n\nBerland War Ministry has ordered you to give answers on $q$ queries, the $i$-th query is given as $(u_i, k_i)$, where $u_i$ is some officer, and $k_i$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo process the $i$-th query imagine how a command from $u_i$ spreads to the subordinates of $u_i$. Typical DFS (depth first search) algorithm is used here.\n\nSuppose the current officer is $a$ and he spreads a command. Officer $a$ chooses $b$ \u2014 one of his direct subordinates (i.e. a child in the tree) who has not received this command yet. If there are many such direct subordinates, then $a$ chooses the one having minimal index. Officer $a$ gives a command to officer $b$. Afterwards, $b$ uses exactly the same algorithm to spread the command to its subtree. After $b$ finishes spreading the command, officer $a$ chooses the next direct subordinate again (using the same strategy). When officer $a$ cannot choose any direct subordinate who still hasn't received this command, officer $a$ finishes spreading the command.\n\nLet's look at the following example: [Image] \n\nIf officer $1$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[1, 2, 3, 5 ,6, 8, 7, 9, 4]$.\n\nIf officer $3$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $7$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[7, 9]$.\n\nIf officer $9$ spreads a command, officers receive it in the following order: $[9]$.\n\nTo answer the $i$-th query $(u_i, k_i)$, construct a sequence which describes the order in which officers will receive the command if the $u_i$-th officer spreads it. Return the $k_i$-th element of the constructed list or -1 if there are fewer than $k_i$ elements in it.\n\nYou should process queries independently. A query doesn't affect the following queries.",

Now to test their team chemistry and IQ skills, Watson told the lads to arrange themselves in such a way that, number of chocolates of the ith kid should be equal to the sum of (i-1)th kid and (i-2)th kid. Now they have arranged themselves in an order. Now Sherlock announced that he will select the students who have formed the line according to this order.

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:   Only one disk can be moved at a time.  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \n\nWith three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^{n} - 1, where n is the number of disks. (c) Wikipedia.\n\nSmallY's puzzle is very similar to the famous Tower of Hanoi. In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle you need to solve a puzzle in minimum number of moves, in SmallY's puzzle each move costs some money and you need to solve the same puzzle but for minimal cost. At the beginning of SmallY's puzzle all n disks are on the first rod. Moving a disk from rod i to rod j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 3) costs t_{ij} units of money. The goal of the puzzle is to move all the disks to the third rod.\n\nIn the problem you are given matrix t and an integer n. You need to count the minimal cost of solving SmallY's puzzle, consisting of n disks.",

If there are ties, the digit `ch` to consider is the first one - in natural digit order - giving `maxcnt`.\n\n- 2) Cut the value `f` into chunks of length at most `25`. The last chunk may be 25 long or less.\n\n```\nExample: for `n=100` you have only one chunk `354224848179261915075`\nExample: for `n=180` f is `18547707689471986212190138521399707760` and you have two chunks \n`1854770768947198621219013` and `8521399707760`. First length here is 25 and second one is 13.\n```\n\n- At last return a string in the following format:\n\"Last chunk ...; Max is ... for digit ...\"\n\nwhere Max is `maxcnt` and digit the first `ch` (in 0..9) leading to `maxcnt`.\n\n```\nExample: for `n=100` -> \"Last chunk 354224848179261915075; Max is 3 for digit 1\" \nExample: for `n=180` -> \"Last chunk 8521399707760; Max is 7 for digit 7\"\nExample: for `n=18000` -> \"Last chunk 140258776000; Max is 409 for digit 1\"\n```\n# Beware: \n`fib(18000)` has `3762` digits.

As you can easily deduce, in the end Vasya drew 2\u00b7n arcs.\n\nFor example, if the numbers are written in the circle in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (in the clockwise direction), then the arcs will join pairs of integers (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1) and (5, 2).\n\nMuch time has passed ever since, the numbers we wiped off the blackboard long ago, but recently Vasya has found a piece of paper with 2\u00b7n written pairs of integers that were joined with the arcs on the board.

The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $i$-th picture has a non-negative weight $w_i$, and the probability of the $i$-th picture being displayed is $\\frac{w_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.\n\nHowever, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. \n\nTo solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $1$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $1$ from its weight.\n\nNauuo will visit the website $m$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $m$ visits modulo $998244353$. Can you help her?\n\nThe expected weight of the $i$-th picture can be denoted by $\\frac {q_i} {p_i}$ where $\\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, you need to print an integer $r_i$ satisfying $0\\le r_i<998244353$ and $r_i\\cdot p_i\\equiv q_i\\pmod{998244353}$.

Note that he may not do that if he wants. More formally, 2D can choose two such indices $i$ and $j$, and one integer $x$ such that $x$ is a divisor of $a_i$, and change powers as following: $a_i = \\frac{a_i}{x}$, $a_j = a_j \\cdot x$\n\nSasha is very curious, that's why he wants to calculate the minimum total power the farmer can reach.

This morning, as usual, he buys a Banh-mi and decides to enjoy it in a special way.\n\nFirst, he splits the Banh-mi into $n$ parts, places them on a row and numbers them from $1$ through $n$. For each part $i$, he defines the deliciousness of the part as $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. JATC's going to eat those parts one by one. At each step, he chooses arbitrary remaining part and eats it. Suppose that part is the $i$-th part then his enjoyment of the Banh-mi will increase by $x_i$ and the deliciousness of all the remaining parts will also increase by $x_i$. The initial enjoyment of JATC is equal to $0$.\n\nFor example, suppose the deliciousness of $3$ parts are $[0, 1, 0]$. If JATC eats the second part then his enjoyment will become $1$ and the deliciousness of remaining parts will become $[1, \\_, 1]$. Next, if he eats the first part then his enjoyment will become $2$ and the remaining parts will become $[\\_, \\_, 2]$. After eating the last part, JATC's enjoyment will become $4$.\n\nHowever, JATC doesn't want to eat all the parts but to save some for later. He gives you $q$ queries, each of them consisting of two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$. For each query, you have to let him know what is the maximum enjoyment he can get if he eats all the parts with indices in the range $[l_i, r_i]$ in some order.\n\nAll the queries are independent of each other. Since the answer to the query could be very large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.",

Thus, there are $3$ divisors of $12$ that are not divisors of $4$ \u2014 $[3,6,12]$.\n\nThere is no edge between $3$ and $2$ because $3$ is not divisible by $2$. There is no edge between $12$ and $3$ because $\\frac{12}{3}=4$ is not a prime.\n\nLet the length of the path between some vertices $v$ and $u$ in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path $[(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)]$ has length $1+2+2+3+1+2=11$. The empty path has length $0$.\n\nSo the shortest path between two vertices $v$ and $u$ is the path that has the minimal possible length.\n\nTwo paths $a$ and $b$ are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position $i$ such that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are different edges.\n\nYou are given $q$ queries of the following form:   $v$ $u$ \u2014 calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices $v$ and $u$. \n\nThe answer for each query might be large so print it modulo $998244353$.",

After hosting a few races, he realised that people do not come there to see the race itself, they come to see racers crash into each other (what's wrong with our generation\u2026). After this realisation, Roger decided to hold a different kind of \"races\": he hired N racers (numbered 1 through N) whose task is to crash into each other.\nAt the beginning, for each valid i, the i-th racer is Xi metres away from the starting point of the track (measured in the clockwise direction) and driving in the direction Di (clockwise or counterclockwise). All racers move with the constant speed 1 metre per second. The lengths of cars are negligible, but the track is only wide enough for one car, so whenever two cars have the same position along the track, they crash into each other and the direction of movement of each of these cars changes (from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa). The cars do not change the directions of their movement otherwise.\nSince crashes reduce the lifetime of the racing cars, Roger sometimes wonders how many crashes happen. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given an integer T and you should find the number of crashes that happen until T seconds have passed (inclusive).",

Since Petya doesn't like to cook, he wants to order these dishes in restaurants.\n\nUnfortunately, all dishes are prepared in different restaurants and therefore Petya needs to pick up his orders from n different places. To speed up this process, he wants to order courier delivery at some restaurants. Thus, for each dish, there are two options for Petya how he can get it: the dish will be delivered by a courier from the restaurant i, in this case the courier will arrive in a_i minutes, Petya goes to the restaurant i on his own and picks up the dish, he will spend b_i minutes on this.\n\nEach restaurant has its own couriers and they start delivering the order at the moment Petya leaves the house. In other words, all couriers work in parallel. Petya must visit all restaurants in which he has not chosen delivery, he does this consistently.\n\nFor example, if Petya wants to order n = 4 dishes and a = [3, 7, 4, 5], and b = [2, 1, 2, 4], then he can order delivery from the first and the fourth restaurant, and go to the second and third on your own. Then the courier of the first restaurant will bring the order in 3 minutes, the courier of the fourth restaurant will bring the order in 5 minutes, and Petya will pick up the remaining dishes in 1 + 2 = 3 minutes. Thus, in 5 minutes all the dishes will be at Petya's house.\n\nFind the minimum time after which all the dishes can be at Petya's home.",

In this game, exactly one ship is used, made up of two rectangles. There are no other ships on the field.\n\nThe rectangles are placed on field in the following way:  the second rectangle is on top the first rectangle;  they are aligned to the left, i.e. their left sides are on the same line;  the rectangles are adjacent to each other without a gap. \n\nSee the pictures in the notes: the first rectangle is colored red, the second rectangle is colored blue.\n\nFormally, let's introduce a coordinate system. Then, the leftmost bottom cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $(1, 1)$, the rightmost top cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $(w_1, h_1)$, the leftmost bottom cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $(1, h_1 + 1)$ and the rightmost top cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $(w_2, h_1 + h_2)$.\n\nAfter the ship is completely destroyed, all cells neighboring by side or a corner with the ship are marked. Of course, only cells, which don't belong to the ship are marked. On the pictures in the notes such cells are colored green.\n\nFind out how many cells should be marked after the ship is destroyed.

      "description": "Once upon a time, a CodeWarrior, after reading a discussion on what can be the plural, took a look at this page and discovered that more than 1 \"kind of plural\" may exist.\n\nFor example Sursurunga Language distinguishes 5 types of numbers: singular (1 thing), dual (2 things), 'trial' or 'lesser paucal' (3 or 4), 'greater paucal' (more than 4) and plural (many).\n\nIn this kata, you'll have to handle only four types of numbers:\n\n- singular: 0 or 1 thing\n- dual: 2 things\n- paucal: 3 to 9 things\n- plural: more than 9 things\n\nTo add some flavor the number-marker will not be added in same places:\n\n- singular, no marker : `1 cat`\n- dual, prefixed \"bu\" : `2 cats -> 2 bucat`\n- paucal, suffixed \"zo\" : `4 cats -> 4 catzo`\n- plural, \"circumfixed ga\" : `100 cats -> 100 gacatga`\n\nAs you all (\"hawk eyes\") have seen, the final `s` of english plural disappears.\n\n( btw these markers, of course, have absolutely nothing to do with true sursurunga language, we're just talking about \"pig\"-sursurunga with pig as pig in \"pig latin\" )\n\nYour Job . . . if you accept it, will be to write a `sursurungal` function which get a `string` as argument and returns this string with words in it eventually converted to their \"pig-sursurunga number type\".\n\nIf a `number` ( ie 1 or more digit ) + a `space` + a `word` ( letters ) are found then the word should be converted.\n\nEach group of `number+space+word` found in the string should be evaluated.\n\nYou may assume at least 1 `number+space+word` group will be provided.\n\nBeware `s` of english plural should be removed, not ending `s` of some singular words ( eg \"kiss\" )",

As a sign of the highest achievements of the deceased king the new king decided to build a mausoleum with Berl IV's body on the main square of the capital.\n\nThe mausoleum will be constructed from 2n blocks, each of them has the shape of a cuboid. Each block has the bottom base of a 1 \u00d7 1 meter square. Among the blocks, exactly two of them have the height of one meter, exactly two have the height of two meters, ..., exactly two have the height of n meters.\n\nThe blocks are arranged in a row without spacing one after the other. Of course, not every arrangement of blocks has the form of a mausoleum. In order to make the given arrangement in the form of the mausoleum, it is necessary that when you pass along the mausoleum, from one end to the other, the heights of the blocks first were non-decreasing (i.e., increasing or remained the same), and then \u2014 non-increasing (decrease or remained unchanged). It is possible that any of these two areas will be omitted. For example, the following sequences of block height meet this requirement:\n\n  [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1];  [1, 1];  [2, 2, 1, 1];  [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]. \n\nSudden k more requirements appeared. Each of the requirements has the form: \"h[x_{i}] sign_{i} h[y_{i}]\", where h[t] is the height of the t-th block, and a sign_{i} is one of the five possible signs: '=' (equals), '<' (less than), '>' (more than), '<=' (less than or equals), '>=' (more than or equals). Thus, each of the k additional requirements is given by a pair of indexes x_{i}, y_{i} (1 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 2n) and sign sign_{i}.\n\nFind the number of possible ways to rearrange the blocks so that both the requirement about the shape of the mausoleum (see paragraph 3) and the k additional requirements were met.",

The permutation contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n). She replaces some of permutation elements with -1 value as a revenge.\n\nWhen Iahub finds out his important permutation is broken, he tries to recover it. The only thing he remembers about the permutation is it didn't have any fixed point. A fixed point for a permutation is an element a_{k} which has value equal to k (a_{k} = k). Your job is to proof to Iahub that trying to recover it is not a good idea. Output the number of permutations which could be originally Iahub's important permutation, modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).",

Each ingredient has a certain tastiness; the tastiness of each ingredient may be any positive integer. Initially, for each tastiness between $K$ and $K+N-1$ (inclusive), Chef has an infinite supply of ingredients with this tastiness.\nThe ingredients have a special property: any two of them can be mixed to create a new ingredient. If the original ingredients had tastiness $x$ and $y$ (possibly $x = y$), the new ingredient has tastiness $x+y$. The ingredients created this way may be used to mix other ingredients as well. Chef is free to mix ingredients in any way he chooses any number of times.\nLet's call a tastiness $v$ ($v > 0$) unreachable if there is no way to obtain an ingredient with tastiness $v$; otherwise, tastiness $v$ is reachable. Chef wants to make ingredients with all reachable values of tastiness and he would like to know the number of unreachable values. Help him solve this problem. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$ ($10^9+7$).\nNote that there is an infinite number of reachable values of tastiness, but it can be proven that the number of unreachable values is always finite for $N \\ge 2$.",

      "description": "Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.\n\nThe function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns `\"now\"`. Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of `years`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds`.\n\nIt is much easier to understand with an example:\n\n```Fortran\nformatDuration (62)    // returns \"1 minute and 2 seconds\"\nformatDuration (3662)  // returns \"1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n```\n```python\nformat_duration(62)    # returns \"1 minute and 2 seconds\"\nformat_duration(3662)  # returns \"1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n```\n\n**For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.**\n\nNote that spaces are important.\n\n### Detailed rules\n\nThe resulting expression is made of components like `4 seconds`, `1 year`, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.\n\nThe components are separated by a comma and a space (`\", \"`). Except the last component, which is separated by `\" and \"`, just like it would be written in English.\n\nA more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, `1 second and 1 year` is not correct, but `1 year and 1 second` is.\n\nDifferent components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in `5 seconds and 1 second`.\n\nA component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, `1 minute and 0 seconds` is not valid, but it should be just `1 minute`.\n\nA unit of time must be used \"as much as possible\". It means that the function should not return `61 seconds`, but `1 minute and 1 second` instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.",

      "description": "You know combinations: for example, if you take 5 cards from a 52 cards deck you have 2,598,960 different combinations.\n\nIn mathematics the number of x combinations you can take from a set of n elements is called the binomial coefficient of n and x, or more often `n choose x`. The formula to compute `m = n choose x` is: `m = n! / (x! * (n - x)!)` where ! is the factorial operator.\n\nYou are a renowned poster designer and painter. You are asked to provide 6 posters all having the same design each in 2 colors. Posters must all have a different color combination and you have the choice of 4 colors: red, blue, yellow, green. How many colors can you choose for each poster?\n\nThe answer is two since `4 choose 2 = 6`. The combinations will be: {red, blue}, {red, yellow}, {red, green}, {blue, yellow}, {blue, green}, {yellow, green}.\n\nNow same question but you have 35 posters to provide and 7 colors available. How many colors for each poster? If you take combinations `7 choose 2` you will get 21 with the above formula. But 21 schemes aren't enough for 35 posters. If you take `7 choose 5` combinations you will get 21 too. Fortunately if you take `7 choose 3` or `7 choose 4` combinations you get 35 and so each poster will have a different combination of 3 colors or 5 colors. You will take 3 colors because it's less expensive.\n\nHence the problem is: knowing `m` (number of posters to design), knowing `n` (total number of available colors), let us search `x` (number of colors for each poster so that each poster has a unique combination of colors and the number of combinations is exactly the same as the number of posters).\n\nIn other words we must find **x** such as `n choose x = m (1)` for a given m and a given n; `m >= 0 and n > 0`. If many x are solutions give as result the smallest x. It can happen that when m is given at random there are no x satisfying `equation (1)` then return -1.",

There are both tasty and nasty cupcakes, so the tastiness can be positive, zero or negative.\n\nYasser, of course, wants to try them all, so he will buy exactly one cupcake of each type.\n\nOn the other hand, Adel will choose some segment $[l, r]$ $(1 \\le l \\le r \\le n)$ that does not include all of cupcakes (he can't choose $[l, r] = [1, n]$) and buy exactly one cupcake of each of types $l, l + 1, \\dots, r$.\n\nAfter that they will compare the total tastiness of the cupcakes each of them have bought. Yasser will be happy if the total tastiness of cupcakes he buys is strictly greater than the total tastiness of cupcakes Adel buys regardless of Adel's choice.\n\nFor example, let the tastinesses of the cupcakes be $[7, 4, -1]$.

The $i$-th picture has a non-negative weight $w_i$, and the probability of the $i$-th picture being displayed is $\\frac{w_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.\n\nHowever, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. \n\nTo solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $1$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $1$ from its weight.\n\nNauuo will visit the website $m$ times.

When Dima pulls the i-th string holding it on the j-th fret the guitar produces a note, let's denote it as a_{ij}. We know that Dima's guitar can produce k distinct notes. It is possible that some notes can be produced in multiple ways. In other words, it is possible that a_{ij} = a_{pq} at (i, j) \u2260 (p, q).\n\nDima has already written a song \u2014 a sequence of s notes. In order to play the song, you need to consecutively produce the notes from the song on the guitar. You can produce each note in any available way. Dima understood that there are many ways to play a song and he wants to play it so as to make the song look as complicated as possible (try to act like Cobein).\n\nWe'll represent a way to play a song as a sequence of pairs (x_{i}, y_{i}) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 s), such that the x_{i}-th string on the y_{i}-th fret produces the i-th note from the song.

This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\n- Then, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\n- Then, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\n- For the better understanding there is an example:\n1\n/           \\\n2                   4\n/   \\                /       \\\n3       5           7        9\n/ \\      /  \\          /  \\       /  \\\n6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20\n\nHere you can see the visualization of the process. For example, in odd levels, the root was enumerated first, then, there were enumerated roots' left sons' sons and roots' right sons' sons.\nYou are given the string of symbols, let's call it S. Each symbol is either l or r.

Note that the obtained strings can contain leading zeroes and that distinct question marks can be replaced by distinct or the same integers.\n\nHelp Yaroslav, calculate the remainder after dividing the described number of ways by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).",

Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.\n\nMoreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) \u2014 the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion \u2014 all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).\n\nLara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times.

(Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3`, and so on.\n\n### Examples\n\nLet's take the number `1232` as an example.\n```\n1     / 1 = 1     // Works\n12    / 2 = 6     // Works\n123   / 3 = 41    // Works\n1232  / 4 = 308   // Works\n```\n`1232` is a polydivisible number.\n\n\nHowever, let's take the number `123220` and see what happens.\n```\n 1      /1 = 1    // Works\n 12     /2 = 6    // Works\n 123    /3 = 41   // Works\n 1232   /4 = 308  // Works\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4         // Doesn't work\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333...  // Doesn't work\n```\n`123220` is not polydivisible.\n\n### Your job: check if a number is polydivisible or not.\n\nReturn `true` if it is, and `false` if it isn't.\n\nNote: All inputs will be valid numbers between `0` and `2^53-1 (9,007,199,254,740,991)` (inclusive).   \nNote: All single digit numbers (including `0`) are trivially polydivisible.\nNote: Except for `0`, no numbers will start with `0`.",

      "description": "You are in Poland and want to order a drink. You need to ask \"One beer please\": \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n\nBut let's say you are really thirsty and want several beers. Then you need to count in Polish. And more difficult, you need to understand the Polish grammar and cases (nominative, genitive, accustative and more).\n\n## The grammar\n\nIn English, the plural of \"beer\" is simply \"beers\", with an \"s\". \n\nIn Polish, the plural of \"piwo\" (nominative singular) is \"piw\" (genitive plural) or \"piwa\" (nominative plural). It depends!\n\nThe rules:\n\n* usually the plural is genitive: \"piw\"\n* but after the numerals 2, 3, 4, and compound numbers ending with them (e.g. 22, 23, 24), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, so nominative: \"piwa\"\n* and exception to the exception: for 12, 13 and 14, it's the genitive plural again: \"piw\" (yes, I know, it's crazy!)\n\n## The numbers\n\nFrom 0 to 9:\n    \n    \"zero\", \"jeden\", \"dwa\", \"trzy\", \"cztery\", \"piec\", \"szesc\" , \"siedem\", \"osiem\", \"dziewiec\"\n\nFrom 10 to 19 it's nearly the same, with \"-ascie\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"jedenascie\", \"dwanascie\", \"trzynascie\", \"czternascie\", \"pietnascie\", \"szesnascie\", \"siedemnascie\", \"osiemnascie\", \"dziewietnascie\"\n\nTens from 10 to 90 are nearly the same, with \"-ziesci\" or \"ziesiat\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"dwadziescia\", \"trzydziesci\", \"czterdziesci\", \"piecdziesiat\", \"szescdziesiat\", \"siedemdziesiat\", \"osiemdziesiat\", \"dziewiecdziesiat\"\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly to English: tens + units. For example, 22 is \"dwadziescia dwa\".\n\n\"One\" could be male (\"Jeden\"), female (\"Jedna\") or neuter (\"Jedno\"), which is the case for \"beer\" (piwo). But all other numbers are invariant, even if ending with \"jeden\".\n\nAh, and by the way, if you don't want to drink alcohol (so no beers are ordered), ask for mineral water instead: \"Woda mineralna\".\n\nNote: if the number of beers is outside your (limited) Polish knowledge (0-99), raise an error!",

The rules of the game are as follows:\n- The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.\n- There is an integer $S$; at the beginning, $S = 0$.\n- In each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of $A$ and either add that number to $S$ or subtract it from $S$. Each element can be selected multiple times.\n- Afterwards, if $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$, the current player (the player who made $S$ equal to $Z_1$ or $Z_2$) is the winner of the game.\n- If the game lasts for $10^{10}$ turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.\nCan you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$ in the first $10^{10}$ moves).\nBoth players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move.

In the bag are ten marbles:\n\n* 1 smooth red marble\n* 4 bumpy red marbles\n* 2 bumpy yellow marbles\n* 1 smooth yellow marble\n* 1 bumpy green marble\n* 1 smooth green marble\n\nYou can see that the probability of picking a smooth red marble from the bag is `1 / 10` or `0.10` and the probability of picking a bumpy yellow marble is `2 / 10` or `0.20`.\n\nThe game works like this: your friend puts her hand in the bag, chooses a marble (without looking at it) and tells you whether it's bumpy or smooth. Then you have to guess which color it is before she pulls it out and reveals whether you're correct or not.\n\nYou know that the information about whether the marble is bumpy or smooth changes the probability of what color it is, and you want some help with your guesses.\n\nWrite a function `color_probability()` that takes two arguments: a color (`'red'`, `'yellow'`, or `'green'`) and a texture (`'bumpy'` or `'smooth'`) and returns the probability as a decimal fraction accurate to two places.\n\nThe probability should be a string and should discard any digits after the 100ths place. For example, `2 / 3` or `0.6666666666666666` would become the string `'0.66'`.

No wonder Grisha feels the same while spending the entire weekend accompanied by pretty striped zebras.\n\nInspired by this adventure and an accidentally found plasticine pack (represented as a sequence of black and white stripes), Grisha now wants to select several consequent (contiguous) pieces of alternating colors to create a zebra. Let's call the number of selected pieces the length of the zebra.\n\nBefore assembling the zebra Grisha can make the following operation $0$ or more times. He splits the sequence in some place into two parts, then reverses each of them and sticks them together again. For example, if Grisha has pieces in the order \"bwbbw\" (here 'b' denotes a black strip, and 'w' denotes a white strip), then he can split the sequence as bw|bbw (here the vertical bar represents the cut), reverse both parts and obtain \"wbwbb\".\n\nDetermine the maximum possible length of the zebra that Grisha can produce.",

      "description": "Little Johnny has recently learned about set theory. Now he is studying binary relations. You've probably heard the term \"equivalence relation\". These relations are very important in many areas of mathematics. For example, the equality of the two numbers is an equivalence relation.\n\nA set \u03c1 of pairs (a, b) of elements of some set A is called a binary relation on set A. For two elements a and b of the set A we say that they are in relation \u03c1, if pair $(a, b) \\in \\rho$, in this case we use a notation $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} b$.\n\nBinary relation is equivalence relation, if: It is reflexive (for any a it is true that $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} a$); It is symmetric (for any a, b it is true that if $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} b$, then $b \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} a$); It is transitive (if $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} b$ and $b \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} c$, than $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} c$).\n\nLittle Johnny is not completely a fool and he noticed that the first condition is not necessary! Here is his \"proof\":\n\nTake any two elements, a and b. If $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} b$, then $b \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} a$ (according to property (2)), which means $a \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\sim} a$ (according to property (3)).\n\nIt's very simple, isn't it? However, you noticed that Johnny's \"proof\" is wrong, and decided to show him a lot of examples that prove him wrong.\n\nHere's your task: count the number of binary relations over a set of size n such that they are symmetric, transitive, but not an equivalence relations (i.e. they are not reflexive).\n\nSince their number may be very large (not 0, according to Little Johnny), print the remainder of integer division of this number by 10^9 + 7.",

      "description": "Denis was very sad after Nastya rejected him. So he decided to walk through the gateways to have some fun. And luck smiled at him! When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something.\n\nDenis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of $n$ steps. At the $i$-th step, a place is chosen for the number $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$. The position for the number $i$ is defined as follows:\n\n  For all $j$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $r_j$  \u2014 the minimum index such that $j \\leq r_j \\leq n$, and the position $r_j$ is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of $r_j$ is not defined.  For all $t$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $count_t$  \u2014 the number of positions $1 \\leq j \\leq n$ such that $r_j$ is defined and $r_j = t$.  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the $count$ array is maximum.  The generator selects one of these positions for the number $i$. The generator can choose any position.\n\nLet's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:\n\n [Image]\n\nLet $n = 5$ and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers $1, 2, 3$ in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number $4$:\n\n  The values of $r$ will be $r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times]$, where $\\times$ means an indefinite value.  Then the $count$ values will be $count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$.  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: $3$ and $4$. The value in the $count$ array for position $3$ is $3$, for position $4$ it is $1$.  The maximum value is reached only for position $3$, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number $4$.\n\nSatisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.\n\nUnfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help. It is necessary to define whether the written permutation could be obtained using the described algorithm if the generator always selects the position Denis needs.",

This murder has been done exactly in the same manner as all the murders happening since the return of the deadly game Gargoyle &Griffins. Betty has decided to put an end to these murders, so they decide to interrogate each and every person in the neighbourhood.\nAs they don't know these people personally they want to first get to know about their character i.e whether a particular person is a Truth\u2212speaking\u2212person or a False\u2212speaking\u2212person. Jughead devises a strategy of interrogating the civilians.\nJughead decides that they will collect statements from all the people in the neighbourhood about every other person living in the neighbourhood. Each person speaks a statement in form of an array consisting of T and F, which tells us what he thinks about the ith person. Let there be N people living in the neighbourhood. So if a person i is giving his/her statement, he/her will always call himself/herself a True person i.e Statement[i]=T.\nSo Jughead says that they will select the maximum number of people that maybe speaking the truth such that their statements don't contradict and then interrogate them further about the murder.\nHelp them pick the max no. of Truth speaking people.\nNote- A person speaking falsely doesn't mean that the complement of his statement would be the truth. If a person is declared false(i.e not included in the set) after Betty and Jughead pick their set of truth speaking people with non-contradicting statements, the person declared false might not be speaking falsely about anyone(except saying he himself is a true speaking person which contradicts with the selected statements) but since the selected Set of statements feels him to be a false speaking person he won't be included in the set.\nBut if a person is tagged as truth speaking person then their Statement must be entirely correct and should not contradict with the chosen set of truth speaking people. All truth speaking people mentioned in the selected statements should be part of the set and all the people declared false in the statements shouldn't be part of the set.",

For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (\":\"). For example, the address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).\n\nHowever, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.\n\nBesides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.\n\nNote:\nYou may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.",

      "description": "New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are n cells numbered by integers from 1 to n, as a 1 \u00d7 n board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.\n\nSo, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of n - 1 positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1. For every integer i where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1 the condition 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n - i holds. Next, he made n - 1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) portal connects cell i and cell (i + a_{i}), and one can travel from cell i to cell (i + a_{i}) using the i-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (i + a_{i}) to cell i using the i-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n - i one can't leave the Line World using portals.\n\nCurrently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell t. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell t by only using the construted transportation system.",

Since blocks are maximal, adjacent blocks have distinct elements, so the array breaks up into a series of blocks.

You have to interleave A and B to form an array C such that C has K blocks.

Note that we are counting the number of interleavings, not the number of different output arrays after interleaving.\n\nThe interleaving process works as follows: Given arrays A and B and an array X of size n+m with exactly n 0's and m 1's, create output array C using this algorithm:\ni = 0, j = 0\nwhile( (i+j)<(n+m) )\n    if(X[i+j+1] == 0)\n        C[i+j+1] = A[i+1]\n        i = i+1\n    else\n        C[i+j+1] = B[j+1]\n        j = j+1\n\nReturn the answer modulo 10^8 + 7.",

More precisely, the immediate station that the train will visit after station i is station i+1 if 1 \u2264 i < n or station 1 if i = n. It takes the train 1 second to travel to its next station as described.\n\nBob gave Alice a fun task before he left: to deliver m candies that are initially at some stations to their independent destinations using the train. The candies are enumerated from 1 through m. Candy i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m), now at station a_i, should be delivered to station b_i (a_i \u2260 b_i).\n\nThe train has infinite capacity, and it is possible to load off any number of candies at a station. However, only at most one candy can be loaded from a station onto the train before it leaves the station. You can choose any candy at this station. The time it takes to move the candies is negligible.\n\nNow, Alice wonders how much time is needed for the train to deliver all candies.

They've got a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The players make moves in turns. BitLGM moves first. Each player can and must do one of the two following actions in his turn:\n\n  Take one of the integers (we'll denote it as a_{i}). Choose integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 a_{i}). And then decrease a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x.  Choose integer x $(1 \\leq x \\leq \\operatorname{min}_{i = 1} a_{i})$. And then decrease all a_{i} by x, that is, apply assignment: a_{i} = a_{i} - x, for all i. \n\nThe player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nYou're given the initial sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Determine who wins, if both players plays optimally well and if BitLGM and BitAryo start playing the described game in this sequence.",

For each problem, p_i is an integer not less than 1.\n\nTwo corporations specializing in problem-solving robot manufacturing, \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" and \"BionicSolver Industries\", are going to register two robots (one for each corporation) for participation as well. Polycarp knows the advantages and flaws of robots produced by these companies, so, for each problem, he knows precisely whether each robot will solve it during the competition. Knowing this, he can try predicting the results \u2014 or manipulating them.\n\nFor some reason (which absolutely cannot involve bribing), Polycarp wants the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot to outperform the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot in the competition. Polycarp wants to set the values of p_i in such a way that the \"Robo-Coder Inc.\" robot gets strictly more points than the \"BionicSolver Industries\" robot. However, if the values of p_i will be large, it may look very suspicious \u2014 so Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum value of p_i over all problems. Can you help Polycarp to determine the minimum possible upper bound on the number of points given for solving the problems?",

Its sorting program needs to make exactly m moves, during the i-th move it swaps elements that are at that moment located at the a_{i}-th and the b_{i}-th positions. But the Little Elephant's sorting program happened to break down and now on every step it can equiprobably either do nothing or swap the required elements.\n\nNow the Little Elephant doesn't even hope that the program will sort the permutation, but he still wonders: if he runs the program and gets some permutation, how much will the result of sorting resemble the sorted one? For that help the Little Elephant find the mathematical expectation of the number of permutation inversions after all moves of the program are completed.\n\nWe'll call a pair of integers i, j (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n) an inversion in permutatuon p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, if the following inequality holds: p_{i} > p_{j}.",

He decides to build N clap activated toggle machines each with one power inlet and one outlet. Each machine works when its power source inlet is receiving power. When the machine is in 'ON' state and is receiving power at its inlet, it makes power available at its power outlet to which a bulb or another ToGgLe machine could be attached.\n\nSuppose Sheldon attached 2 such machines to one another with the power inlet of the first machine attached to a power source at his house and the outlet of the second machine to a bulb. Initially both machines are in 'OFF' state and power source to first machine is off too. Now the power source is switched on. The first machine receives power but being in the 'OFF' state it does not transmit any power. Now on clapping the first ToGgLe machine toggles to 'ON' and the second machine receives power. On clapping once more the first toggles to 'OFF' and the second toggles to 'ON'. But since the second ToGgLe machine receives no power the bulb does not light up yet. On clapping once more, the first machine which is still receiving power from the source toggles to 'ON' and the second which was already 'ON' does not toggle since it was not receiving power. So both the machine are in 'ON' state and the bulb lights up and little Sheldon is happy.\n\nBut when Sheldon goes out for a while, his evil twin sister attaches N such ToGgLe machines (after making sure they were all in 'OFF' state) and attaches the first to a power source (the power source is initially switched off) and the last ToGgLe machine to a bulb. Sheldon is horrified to find that his careful arrangement has been disturbed.\n\nCoders, help the poor boy by finding out if clapping k times for the N ToGgLe machines (all in 'OFF' state with the first one connected to a switched off power source and last one to a bulb) would light the bulb.

For example, sequence [0, 2, 1] is a permutation of length 3 while both [0, 2, 2] and [1, 2, 3] are not.\n\nA fixed point of a function is a point that is mapped to itself by the function. A permutation can be regarded as a bijective function. We'll get a definition of a fixed point in a permutation. An integer i is a fixed point of permutation a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} - 1 if and only if a_{i} = i. For example, permutation [0, 2, 1] has 1 fixed point and permutation [0, 1, 2] has 3 fixed points.\n\nYou are given permutation a. You are allowed to swap two elements of the permutation at most once. Your task is to maximize the number of fixed points in the resulting permutation.

There is a wormhole V that transports you from your house to the examination centre and another wormhole W that transports you from the examination centre back to your house. Obviously, transportation through a wormhole does not take any time; it is instantaneous. But the wormholes can be used at only certain fixed times, and these are known to you.\n\nSo, you use a V wormhole to reach the exam centre, possibly wait for some time before the next contest begins, take part in the contest, possibly wait for some more time and then use a W wormhole to return back home. If you leave through a V wormhole at time t1 and come back through a W wormhole at time t2, then the total time you have spent is (t2 - t1 + 1).

Its positions are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nHe wants to modify his string so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'. To achieve that, Nikolay can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose some position in his string and replace the letter on this position with the other letter (i.e. replace 'a' with 'b' or replace 'b' with 'a'). Nikolay can use no letters except 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe prefix of string s of length l (1 \u2264 l \u2264 n) is a string s[1..l].\n\nFor example, for the string s=\"abba\" there are two prefixes of the even length. The first is s[1\u20262]=\"ab\" and the second s[1\u20264]=\"abba\". Both of them have the same number of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string s to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'.",

This year, he decides to prepare n boxes of chocolate, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th box contains a_i chocolate pieces.\n\nSince Bob is a typical nice guy, he will not send Alice n empty boxes. In other words, at least one of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is positive. Since Alice dislikes coprime sets, she will be happy only if there exists some integer k > 1 such that the number of pieces in each box is divisible by k. Note that Alice won't mind if there exists some empty boxes.\n\nCharlie, Alice's boyfriend, also is Bob's second best friend, so he decides to help Bob by rearranging the chocolate pieces. In one second, Charlie can pick up a piece in box i and put it into either box i-1 or box i+1 (if such boxes exist). Of course, he wants to help his friend as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately for him, anything and everything has been done already, and there are no more possible improvements he can think of during the day (he now prefers to sleep at night). However, his assistants have found a solution and they now draw an imaginary city on a paper sheet and suggest the mayor can propose its improvements.\n\nRight now he has a map of some imaginary city with $n$ subway stations. Some stations are directly connected with tunnels in such a way that the whole map is a tree (assistants were short on time and enthusiasm). It means that there exists exactly one simple path between each pair of station. We call a path simple if it uses each tunnel no more than once.\n\nOne of Sergey Semyonovich's favorite quality objectives is the sum of all pairwise distances between every pair of stations. The distance between two stations is the minimum possible number of tunnels on a path between them.\n\nSergey Semyonovich decided to add new tunnels to the subway map. In particular, he connected any two stations $u$ and $v$ that were not connected with a direct tunnel but share a common neighbor, i.e. there exists such a station $w$ that the original map has a tunnel between $u$ and $w$ and a tunnel between $w$ and $v$.

It is known that the company has already bought n plots along the highway and is preparing to build n skyscrapers, one skyscraper per plot.\n\nArchitects must consider several requirements when planning a skyscraper. Firstly, since the land on each plot has different properties, each skyscraper has a limit on the largest number of floors it can have. Secondly, according to the design code of the city, it is unacceptable for a skyscraper to simultaneously have higher skyscrapers both to the left and to the right of it.\n\nFormally, let's number the plots from 1 to n. Then if the skyscraper on the i-th plot has a_i floors, it must hold that a_i is at most m_i (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 m_i). Also there mustn't be integers j and k such that j < i < k and a_j > a_i < a_k. Plots j and k are not required to be adjacent to i.\n\nThe company wants the total number of floors in the built skyscrapers to be as large as possible.

He can only pull the box if he stands exactly $1$ unit away from the box in the direction of one of two coordinate axes. He will pull the box to where he is standing before moving out of the way in the same direction by $1$ unit.\n\nFor example, if the box is at the point $(1,2)$ and Wabbit is standing at the point $(2,2)$, he can pull the box right by $1$ unit, with the box ending up at the point $(2,2)$ and Wabbit ending at the point $(3,2)$.\n\nAlso, Wabbit can move $1$ unit to the right, left, up, or down without pulling the box. In this case, it is not necessary for him to be in exactly $1$ unit away from the box. If he wants to pull the box again, he must return to a point next to the box. Also, Wabbit can't move to the point where the box is located.\n\nWabbit can start at any point.

He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.\n\nThe device is powered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one.\n\nMike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the \"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut.\n\nThe input contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000). The i-th position of the sequence contains the character \"+\", if on the i-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\" wire, and the character \"-\" otherwise.",

Same goes for all the numbers up to 109, while 110 is again a decreasing number.\n\nNow your task is rather easy to declare (a bit less to perform): you have to build a function to return the total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers *below* 10 raised to the xth power (x will always be >= 0).\n\nTo give you a starting point, there are a grand total of increasing and decreasing numbers as shown in the table:\n\n|Total  | Below\n|---------------\n|1      | 1\n|10     | 10\n|100    | 100\n|475    | 1000\n|1675   | 10000\n|4954   | 100000\n|12952  | 1000000\n\nThis means that your function will have to behave like this:\n```python\ntotal_inc_dec(0)==1\ntotal_inc_dec(1)==10\ntotal_inc_dec(2)==100\ntotal_inc_dec(3)==475\ntotal_inc_dec(4)==1675\ntotal_inc_dec(5)==4954\ntotal_inc_dec(6)==12952\n```\n\n**Tips:** efficiency and trying to figure out how it works are essential: with a brute force approach, some tests with larger numbers may take more than the total computing power currently on Earth to be finished in the short allotted time.\n\nTo make it even clearer, the increasing or decreasing numbers between in the range 101-200 are: [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200], that is 47 of them. In the following range, 201-300, there are 41 of them and so on, getting rarer and rarer.\n\n**Trivia:** just for the sake of your own curiosity, a number which is neither decreasing of increasing is called a `bouncy` number, like, say, 3848 or 37294; also, usually 0 is not considered being increasing, decreasing or bouncy, but it will be for the purpose of this kata",

Two integral points A and B on the plane are 4-connected if and only if: the Euclidean distance between A and B is one unit and neither A nor B is blocked; or there is some integral point C, such that A is 4-connected with C, and C is 4-connected with B.\n\nLet's assume that the plane doesn't contain blocked points. Consider all the integral points of the plane whose Euclidean distance from the origin is no more than n, we'll name these points special. Chubby Yang wants to get the following property: no special point is 4-connected to some non-special point. To get the property she can pick some integral points of the plane and make them blocked. What is the minimum number of points she needs to pick?",

An increasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing subsequences.\n\nNam realizes that a sequence may have several longest increasing subsequences. Hence, he divides all indexes i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), into three groups: group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to no longest increasing subsequences. group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to at least one but not every longest increasing subsequence. group of all i such that a_{i} belongs to every longest increasing subsequence.\n\nSince the number of longest increasing subsequences of a may be very large, categorizing process is very difficult.

The tiles 10 (already present) and 10 (newly formed) would then merge in the same move to form (20, 20, 40), and that will form (40, 40), which will form (80).

      "description": "You are the \"computer expert\" of a local Athletic Association (C.A.A.). Many teams of runners come to compete. Each time you get a string of all race results of every team who has run. For example here is a string showing the individual results of a team of 5 runners: \"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17\". Each part of the string is of the form: h|m|s where h, m, s (h for hour, m for minutes, s for seconds) are positive or null integer (represented as strings) with one or two digits. There are no traps in this format. To compare the results of the teams you are asked for giving three statistics; range, average and median. Range: difference between the lowest and highest values. In {4, 6, 9, 3, 7} the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9, so the range is 9 \u2212 3 = 6. Mean or Average: To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers in a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers. Median: In statistics, the median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one (e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5) when there is an odd number of observations. If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then defined to be the mean of the two middle values (the median of {3, 5, 6, 9} is (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5). Your task is to return a string giving these 3 values. For the example given above, the string result will be \"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34\" of the form: \"Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss\" where hh, mm, ss are integers (represented by strings) with each 2 digits. Remarks: 1. if a result in seconds is ab.xy... it will be given truncated as ab. 2. if the given string is \"\" you will return \"\"",

You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a **signature** of X elements *- and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements -* and returns the first **n** elements of the so seeded sequence.\n\n```\nxbonacci {1,1,1,1} 10 = {1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94}\nxbonacci {0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16}\nxbonacci {1,0,0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6}\nxbonacci {1,1} produces the Fibonacci sequence\n```",

Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.\n\nLet's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers $f(a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 \\dots b_{q - 1} b_q)$, where $a_1 \\dots a_p$ and $b_1 \\dots b_q$ are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.\n\nIn other words, the function $f(x, y)$ alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers $x$ and $y$ by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number $y$. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.\n\nFor example: $$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212$$ $$f(7777, 888) = 7787878$$ $$f(33, 44444) = 4443434$$ $$f(555, 6) = 5556$$ $$f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$\n\nFormally,  if $p \\ge q$ then $f(a_1 \\dots a_p, b_1 \\dots b_q) = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$;  if $p < q$ then $f(a_1 \\dots a_p, b_1 \\dots b_q) = b_1 b_2 \\dots b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$. \n\nMishanya gives you an array consisting of $n$ integers $a_i$, your task is to help students to calculate $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\sum_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j)$ modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.",

      "description": "Om Nom really likes candies and doesn't like spiders as they frequently steal candies. One day Om Nom fancied a walk in a park. Unfortunately, the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesn't want to see them at all.\n\nThe park can be represented as a rectangular n \u00d7 m field. The park has k spiders, each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field. The spiders move all the time, and each spider always moves in one of the four directions (left, right, down, up). In a unit of time, a spider crawls from his cell to the side-adjacent cell in the corresponding direction. If there is no cell in the given direction, then the spider leaves the park. The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move. Specifically, one cell can have multiple spiders at the same time.\n\nOm Nom isn't yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants: to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field (it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders); to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row (the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park).\n\nWe know that Om Nom moves by jumping. One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a side-adjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundaries.\n\nEach time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time. Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from. That's why he wonders: for each possible starting cell, how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell? Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell.",

No two segments connect the same pair of points, and no segment connects the point to itself. Masha wants to color some segments in order paint a hedgehog. In Mashas mind every hedgehog consists of a tail and some spines. She wants to paint the tail that satisfies the following conditions:   Only segments already presented on the picture can be painted;  The tail should be continuous, i.e. consists of some sequence of points, such that every two neighbouring points are connected by a colored segment;  The numbers of points from the beginning of the tail to the end should strictly increase. \n\nMasha defines the length of the tail as the number of points in it. Also, she wants to paint some spines. To do so, Masha will paint all the segments, such that one of their ends is the endpoint of the tail. Masha defines the beauty of a hedgehog as the length of the tail multiplied by the number of spines. Masha wants to color the most beautiful hedgehog. Help her calculate what result she may hope to get.\n\nNote that according to Masha's definition of a hedgehog, one segment may simultaneously serve as a spine and a part of the tail (she is a little girl after all).

Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\nNote the following:\n- At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard.\n- The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day.\n- They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1.\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard.

Being a friend of Choota Bheem he never has to struggle for anything, because of this he is in a great debt of Choota Bheem, he really wants to pay his debt off.\nFinally the time has come to pay his debt off, Jaggu is on a magical tree. He wants to collect apples from different branches but he is in a hurry. Botakpur has attacked on Dholakpur and Bheem is severely injured, as been instructed by the village witch, Bheem can only be saved by the apples of the magical tree. Each apple is placed in Tree Node structure and each apple has some sweetness. Now there's a problem as Jaggu is also injured so he can only slide downwards and alse is collecting apples in his hand so he can't climb. You would be given Q queries. Queries are of 2 type :-\n- Ending Node Node of Jaggu is given. format - type of query node -(1 2)\n- Sweetness of Apple on a given node is changed. format - type of query node new sweetness(2 3 10)\nNote: Jaggu is always on the top of tree initially in each query.The sweetness is always positive.\nHelp Jaggu in saving Bheem",

The pattern's length varies with every test, but the alternation between encoded text and an encoded number will always be there. Following this rule, each number tested begins with encoded text and ends with an encoded number.\n\nHow the encoding works:\nFirst, some text is taken, and encoded. The system of encoding is taking each letter's position in the alphabet and adding 100 to it. For example, `m` in the real text would be `113` in the code-number.\n\nAfter the text, there is a binary number. You should convert this number to a normal, base 10 decimal (all of them can be converted into whole, non-negative numbers).\n\nSeparating encoded text and encoded numbers, there is a `98`. Because the numbers are in binary, the only digits they use are '0' and '1', and each letter of the alphabet, encoded, is between 101-127, all instances of `98` are to indicate a separation between encoded text and encoded numbers. There may also be a `98` at the very end of the number.\n\nWhen you return your final answer, the text and numbers should always be separated by a comma (`,`).",

For example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"()\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while the bracket sequences \")(\", \"(()\" and \"(()))\" are not correct.\n\nYuhao found this problem too simple for him so he decided to make the problem harder. You are given many (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences. The task is to connect some of them into ordered pairs so that each bracket sequence occurs in at most one pair and the concatenation of the bracket sequences in each pair is a correct bracket sequence.

For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n\u00b7(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.",

Each serve is won by one of the players, this player scores one point. As soon as one of the players scores t points, he wins the set; then the next set starts and scores of both players are being set to 0. As soon as one of the players wins the total of s sets, he wins the match and the match is over. Here s and t are some positive integer numbers.\n\nTo spice it up, Petya and Gena choose new numbers s and t before every match. Besides, for the sake of history they keep a record of each match: that is, for each serve they write down the winner. Serve winners are recorded in the chronological order. In a record the set is over as soon as one of the players scores t points and the match is over as soon as one of the players wins s sets.\n\nPetya and Gena have found a record of an old match. Unfortunately, the sequence of serves in the record isn't divided into sets and numbers s and t for the given match are also lost. The players now wonder what values of s and t might be.

They represent the clock-cycles(cc) needed to finish the job.\n2. \"index\" a positive integer. That represents the job we're interested in.\n\nSJF returns:\n\n1. A positive integer representing the cc it takes to complete the job at index.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nSJF([3, 10, 20, 1, 2], 0)\nat 0cc [3, 10, 20, 1, 2] jobs[3] starts\nat 1cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 2] jobs[3] finishes, jobs[4] starts\nat 3cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[4] finishes, jobs[0] starts\nat 6cc [0, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[0] finishes\n```\n\nso:\n```\nSJF([3,10,20,1,2], 0) == 6\n```",

Fouriest transformations are harder.\n\nThis Kata is based on the SMBC Comic on fourier transformations.\n\nA fourier transformation on a number is one that converts the number to a base in which it has more `4`s ( `10` in base `6` is `14`, which has `1` four as opposed to none, hence, fourier in base `6` ).\n\nA number's fouriest transformation converts it to the base in which it has the most `4`s.\nFor example: `35353` is the fouriest in base `6`: `431401`.\n\nThis kata requires you to create a method `fouriest` that takes a number and makes it the fouriest, telling us in which base this happened, as follows:\n\n```python\nfouriest(number) -> \"{number} is the fouriest ({fouriest_representation}) in base {base}\"\n```\n\n## Important notes\n\n* For this kata we don't care about digits greater than `9` ( only `0` to `9` ), so we will represent all digits greater than `9` as `'x'`: `10` in base `11` is `'x'`, `119` in base `20` is `'5x'`, `118` in base `20` is also `'5x'`\n\n* When a number has several fouriest representations, we want the one with the LOWEST base\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n\"30 is the fouriest (42) in base 7\"\n\"15 is the fouriest (14) in base 11\"\n```",

First of all, she will choose some city $c_1$ to start her journey. She will visit it, and after that go to some other city $c_2 > c_1$, then to some other city $c_3 > c_2$, and so on, until she chooses to end her journey in some city $c_k > c_{k - 1}$. So, the sequence of visited cities $[c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k]$ should be strictly increasing.\n\nThere are some additional constraints on the sequence of cities Tanya visits. Each city $i$ has a beauty value $b_i$ associated with it. If there is only one city in Tanya's journey, these beauty values imply no additional constraints.

Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-gaps primes: `3-5, 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, 29-31, 41-43`\n\nA prime gap of length n is a run of n-1 consecutive composite numbers between two **successive** primes (see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeGaps.html).\n\nWe will write a function gap with parameters:\n\n`g` (integer >= 2) which indicates the gap we are looking for\n\n`m` (integer > 2) which gives the start of the search (m inclusive)\n\n`n` (integer >= m) which gives the end of the search (n inclusive)\n\nIn the example above `gap(2, 3, 50)` will return `[3, 5] or (3, 5) or {3, 5}` which is the first pair between 3 and 50 with a 2-gap.\n\nSo this function should return the **first** pair of two prime numbers spaced with a gap of `g` between the limits `m`, `n` if these numbers exist otherwise `nil or null or None or Nothing` (depending on the language).\n\nIn C++ return in such a case `{0, 0}`. In F# return `[||]`. In Kotlin return `[]`\n\n#Examples:\n`gap(2, 5, 7) --> [5, 7] or (5, 7) or {5, 7}`\n\n`gap(2, 5, 5) --> nil. In C++ {0, 0}. In F# [||]. In Kotlin return `[]`\n\n`gap(4, 130, 200) --> [163, 167] or (163, 167) or {163, 167}`\n\n([193, 197] is also such a 4-gap primes between 130 and 200 but it's not the first pair)\n\n`gap(6,100,110) --> nil or {0, 0}` : between 100 and 110 we have `101, 103, 107, 109` but `101-107`is not a 6-gap because there is `103`in between and `103-109`is not a 6-gap because there is `107`in between.",

      "description": "Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by n streets along the Eastern direction and m streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has nm intersections. At any intersection of i-th Eastern street and j-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings.\n\nWhen Dora passes through the intersection of the i-th Eastern and j-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change.\n\nFormally, on every of nm intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees n + m - 1 skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result \"greater\", \"smaller\" or \"equal\". Now Dora wants to select some integer x and assign every skyscraper a height from 1 to x. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible x.\n\nHelp Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.",

He immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam that he could find.\n\nAnd now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down his friend.

Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right doors in the same position.

Start with `n = 213` (as an example).\n2. To approximate the square root of n, we will first find the greatest perfect square that is below or equal to `n`. (In this example, that would be 196, or 14 squared.) We will call the square root of this number (which means sqrt 196, or 14) `base`.\n3. Then, we will take the lowest perfect square that is greater than or equal to `n`. (In this example, that would be 225, or 15 squared.)\n4. Next, subtract 196 (greatest perfect square less than or equal to `n`) from `n`. (213 - 196 = **17**) We will call this value `diff_gn`.\n5. Find the difference between the lowest perfect square greater than or equal to `n` and the greatest perfect square less than or equal to `n`. (225 \u2013 196 = **29**) We will call this value `diff_lg`.\n6. Your final answer is `base` + (`diff_gn` / `diff_lg`). In this example: 14 + (17 / 29) which is 14.59, rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nJust to clarify, if the input is a perfect square itself, you should return the exact square of the input.\n\nIn case you are curious, the approximation (computed like above) for 213 rounded to four decimal places is 14.5862. The actual square root of 213 is 14.5945.\n\nInputs will always be positive whole numbers.

Today Marina offered Vova to cope with the following task.\n\nVova has a non-directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the operation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an edge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead of them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from it to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the vertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added from x to it). Thus, as a result of contraction again a non-directed graph is formed, it contains no loops nor multiple edges, and it contains (n - 1) vertices.\n\nVova must perform the contraction an arbitrary number of times to transform the given graph into a chain of the maximum length. A chain of length k (k \u2265 0) is a connected graph whose vertices can be numbered with integers from 1 to k + 1 so that the edges of the graph connect all pairs of vertices (i, i + 1) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and only them. Specifically, the graph that consists of one vertex is a chain of length 0. The vertices that are formed as a result of the contraction are allowed to be used in the following operations of contraction.\n\nHelp Vova cope with his girlfriend's task.

Thus an employee may manage any number of other employees but he reports only to one manager, so that the organization forms a tree with Mr. Hojo at the root. We say that employee B is a subordinate of employee A if B appears in the subtree rooted at A.\n\n\tMr. Hojo, has hired Nikhil to analyze data about the employees to suggest how to identify faults in Boing Inc.

Note that this can be negative if the employee is in debt. He has already decided that he will present evidence that wealth falls rapidly as one goes down the organizational tree. He plans to identify a pair of employees i and j, j a subordinate of i, such A[i] - A[j] is maximum. Your task is to help him do this.\n\n\tSuppose, Boing Inc has 4 employees and the parent (P[i]) and wealth information (A[i]) for each employee are as follows:\n\ni\t\t1\t2\t3\t4\nA[i]\t\t5\t10\t6\t12\nP[i]\t\t2\t-1\t4\t2\n\nP[2] = -1 indicates that employee 2 has no manager, so employee 2 is Mr. Hojo.\n\nIn this case, the possible choices to consider are (2,1) with a difference in wealth of 5, (2,3) with 4, (2,4) with -2 and (4,3) with 6.

But this is no problem for Chef, because Chef is very creative and can just invent new digit symbols when she needs them. (Chef is very creative.)\nChef also noticed that in base two, all positive integers start with the digit 1! However, this is the only base where this is true.

It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So n is a number such that n + 1 is a power of 2.\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to n in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given n answers q queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number u_i (1 \u2264 u_i \u2264 n) and a string s_i, where u_i is the number of vertex, and s_i represents the path starting from this vertex. String s_i doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from s_i have to be processed from left to right, considering that u_i is the vertex where the path starts.

For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 \u2192 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 \u2192 \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212.

In this game, he fights monsters using magic spells.\n\nThere are two types of spells: fire spell of power $x$ deals $x$ damage to the monster, and lightning spell of power $y$ deals $y$ damage to the monster and doubles the damage of the next spell Polycarp casts. Each spell can be cast only once per battle, but Polycarp can cast them in any order.\n\nFor example, suppose that Polycarp knows three spells: a fire spell of power $5$, a lightning spell of power $1$, and a lightning spell of power $8$. There are $6$ ways to choose the order in which he casts the spells:\n\n  first, second, third. This order deals $5 + 1 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 22$ damage;  first, third, second. This order deals $5 + 8 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 15$ damage;  second, first, third. This order deals $1 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 8 = 19$ damage;  second, third, first. This order deals $1 + 2 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 27$ damage;  third, first, second. This order deals $8 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 19$ damage;  third, second, first. This order deals $8 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 20$ damage. \n\nInitially, Polycarp knows $0$ spells.

So I borrowed my friend's \"Clone Machine\" and cloned myself :-) Now my clone can do my Kata solutions for me and I can relax! Furthermore, at the end of the day my clone can re-clone herself... So as I left for the airport I gave my clone instructions to: do my Kata solutions for me, feed the cat, try to keep the house tidy and not eat too much, sleep, clone yourself, repeat same next day. Well, how was I supposed to know that cloned DNA is faulty? Every time they sleep they wake up with decreased ability - they get slower... they get dumber... they are only able to solve 1 less Kata than they could the previous day. For example, if they can solve 10 Kata today, then tomorrow they can solve only 9 Kata, then 8, 7, 6... Eventually they can't do much more than sit around all day playing video games. And (unlike me), when the clone cannot solve any more Kata they are no longer clever enough to operate the clone machine either! Write a method to predict the final outcome where Input: kata-per-day is the number of Kata I can solve per day. Output: [number-of-clones, number-of-kata-solved-by-clones]",

A disjunction is true if and only if 1 or more of its operands is true. In programming, we typically denote a disjunction using \"||\", but in logic we typically use \"v\".\nExample of disjunction:\np = 1 > 2 = false\nq = 2 < 3 = true\ntherefore p v q is true\nIn a programming language, we might write this as:\nvar p = 1 > 2;        // false\nvar q = 2 < 3;        // true\nvar result = p || q;  // true\nThe above example demonstrates an inclusive disjunction (meaning it includes cases where both operands are true). Disjunctions can also be exclusive. An exclusive disjunction is typically represented by \"\u22bb\" and is true if and only if both operands have opposite values.\np = 1 < 2 = true\nq = 2 < 3 = true\ntherefore p \u22bb q is false\nThis can become confusing when dealing with more than 2 operands.\nr = 3 < 4 = true\np \u22bb q \u22bb r = ???\nWe handle these situations by evaluating the expression from left to right.\np \u22bb q = false\n(p \u22bb q) \u22bb r = true\nDirections:\nFor this kata, your task is to implement a function that performs a disjunction operation on 2 or more propositions.\n\nShould take a boolean array as its first parameter and a single boolean as its second parameter, which, if true, should indicate that the disjunction should be exclusive as opposed to inclusive.\nShould return true or false.",

      "description": "Andrew skipped lessons on the subject 'Algorithms and Data Structures' for the entire term. When he came to the final test, the teacher decided to give him a difficult task as a punishment.\n\nThe teacher gave Andrew an array of n numbers a_1, ..., a_{n}. After that he asked Andrew for each k from 1 to n - 1 to build a k-ary heap on the array and count the number of elements for which the property of the minimum-rooted heap is violated, i.e. the value of an element is less than the value of its parent.\n\nAndrew looked up on the Wikipedia that a k-ary heap is a rooted tree with vertices in elements of the array. If the elements of the array are indexed from 1 to n, then the children of element v are elements with indices k(v - 1) + 2, ..., kv + 1 (if some of these elements lie outside the borders of the array, the corresponding children are absent). In any k-ary heap every element except for the first one has exactly one parent; for the element 1 the parent is absent (this element is the root of the heap). Denote p(v) as the number of the parent of the element with the number v. Let's say that for a non-root element v the property of the heap is violated if a_{v} < a_{p}(v).\n\nHelp Andrew cope with the task!",

For example, if you pronounce 'c', 'o', 'd', and 'e' in that order, then the machine will inscribe \"code\" onto the paper. Thanks to this machine, she can finally write messages without using her glasses.\n\nHowever, her dumb friend Akko decided to play a prank on her. Akko tinkered with the machine so that if you pronounce 'w', it will inscribe \"uu\" instead of \"w\", and if you pronounce 'm', it will inscribe \"nn\" instead of \"m\"! Since Constanze had bad eyesight, she was not able to realize what Akko did.\n\nThe rest of the letters behave the same as before: if you pronounce any letter besides 'w' and 'm', the machine will just inscribe it onto a piece of paper.\n\nThe next day, I received a letter in my mailbox. I can't understand it so I think it's either just some gibberish from Akko, or Constanze made it using her machine. But since I know what Akko did, I can just list down all possible strings that Constanze's machine would have turned into the message I got and see if anything makes sense.\n\nBut I need to know how much paper I will need, and that's why I'm asking you for help. Tell me the number of strings that Constanze's machine would've turned into the message I got.\n\nBut since this number can be quite large, tell me instead its remainder when divided by $10^9+7$.\n\nIf there are no strings that Constanze's machine would've turned into the message I got, then print $0$.",

This completes the first part of our walk and we denote this walk by  ($1$ $2$ $4$ $1$). Such a walk is called a cycle. An interesting property of such walks, that you may take for granted, is that the position we revisit will always be the one we started from!\nWe continue our walk by jumping to first unvisited position, in this case position $3$ and continue in the same manner. This time we find $5$ at position $3$ and so we go to position $5$ and find $7$ and we go to position $7$ and find $3$ and thus we get the cycle ($3$ $5$ $7$ $3$).

You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine.

For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money.

Okabe wants Daru to throw away the boxes in the order from 1 to n. Of course, this means that it might be impossible for Daru to perform some of Okabe's remove commands, because the required box is not on the top of the stack.\n\nThat's why Daru can decide to wait until Okabe looks away and then reorder the boxes in the stack in any way he wants. He can do it at any point of time between Okabe's commands, but he can't add or remove boxes while he does it.\n\nTell Daru the minimum number of times he needs to reorder the boxes so that he can successfully complete all of Okabe's commands.

For Freud, the answer was quite different.\n\nIn the society he lived in, people-women in particular- had to repress their sexual needs and desires. This was simply how the society was at the time. \nFreud then wanted to study the illnesses created by this, and so he digged to the root of their desires. This led to some of the most important psychoanalytic theories to this day, Freud being the father of psychoanalysis.\n\nNow, basically, when a person hears about Freud, s/he hears \"sex\" because for Freud, everything was basically related to, and explained by sex. \n\nIn this kata, the toFreud() function will take a string as its argument, and return a string with every word replaced by the explanation to everything, according to Freud.

However, at the time of curfew it happened that many students are not located in their assigned rooms. The rooms are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to n. Initially, in i-th room there are a_{i} students. All students are currently somewhere in the house, therefore a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} = nb. Also 2 instructors live in this house.\n\nThe process of curfew enforcement is the following. One instructor starts near room 1 and moves toward room n, while the second instructor starts near room n and moves toward room 1. After processing current room, each instructor moves on to the next one. Both instructors enter rooms and move simultaneously, if n is odd, then only the first instructor processes the middle room. When all rooms are processed, the process ends.\n\nWhen an instructor processes a room, she counts the number of students in the room, then turns off the light, and locks the room. Also, if the number of students inside the processed room is not equal to b, the instructor writes down the number of this room into her notebook (and turns off the light, and locks the room). Instructors are in a hurry (to prepare the study plan for the next day), so they don't care about who is in the room, but only about the number of students.\n\nWhile instructors are inside the rooms, students can run between rooms that are not locked and not being processed. A student can run by at most d rooms, that is she can move to a room with number that differs my at most d. Also, after (or instead of) running each student can hide under a bed in a room she is in. In this case the instructor will not count her during the processing. In each room any number of students can hide simultaneously.\n\nFormally, here is what's happening:  A curfew is announced, at this point in room i there are a_{i} students.  Each student can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her initial room, or stay in place. After that each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors enter room 1 and room n, they count students there and lock the room (after it no one can enter or leave this room).  Each student from rooms with numbers from 2 to n - 1 can run to another room but not further than d rooms away from her current room, or stay in place. Each student can optionally hide under a bed.  Instructors move from room 1 to room 2 and from room n to room n - 1.  This process continues until all rooms are processed. \n\nLet x_1 denote the number of rooms in which the first instructor counted the number of non-hidden students different from b, and x_2 be the same number for the second instructor. Students know that the principal will only listen to one complaint, therefore they want to minimize the maximum of numbers x_{i}. Help them find this value if they use the optimal strategy.",

Remind that a geometric progression is a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, b_3, ..., where for each i > 1 the respective term satisfies the condition b_{i} = b_{i} - 1\u00b7q, where q is called the common ratio of the progression. Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both b_1 and q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha m \"bad\" integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m}, and an integer l.\n\nMasha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board (including repetitive) while condition |b_{i}| \u2264 l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of the \"bad\" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto the board) and moves forward to the next term.\n\nBut the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate how many numbers she will write, or print \"inf\" in case she needs to write infinitely many integers.",

      "description": "Little Petya likes permutations a lot. Recently his mom has presented him permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n} of length n.\n\nA permutation a of length n is a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n), all integers there are distinct.\n\nThere is only one thing Petya likes more than permutations: playing with little Masha. As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules: Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below. During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2. Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p. All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p.\n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.",

In this game there are three identical cups arranged in a line from left to right. Initially key to Barney's heart is under the middle cup.\n\nThen at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts n turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start.\n\nAfter n-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him the probability that girl guessed right.\n\nNumber n of game turns can be extremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} such that n = \u220f_{i = 1}^{k} a_{i}\n\nin other words, n is multiplication of all elements of the given array.\n\nBecause of precision difficulties, Barney asked you to tell him the answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need to find it as a fraction p / q such that gcd(p, q) = 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor. Since p and q can be extremely large, you only need to find the remainders of dividing each of them by 10^9 + 7.\n\nPlease note that we want gcd of p and q to be 1, not gcd of their remainders after dividing by 10^9 + 7.",

He knew that constructing the list of voters is a difficult task, prone to errors. Some voters may have been away on vacation, others may have moved during the enrollment and so on. To be as accurate as possible, he entrusted the task to three different officials. Each of them was to independently record the list of voters and send it to the collector. In Siruseri, every one has a ID number and the list would only list the ID numbers of the voters and not their names. The officials were expected to arrange the ID numbers in ascending order in their lists. On receiving the lists, the Collector realised that there were discrepancies - the three lists were not identical. He decided to go with the majority. That is, he decided to construct the final list including only those ID numbers that appeared in at least 2 out of the 3 lists. For example if the three lists were 23 30 42 57 90, 21 23 35 57 90 92, 21 23 30 57 90 then the final list compiled by the collector would be: 21 23 30 57 90.

      "description": "One day Greg and his friends were walking in the forest. Overall there were n people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms.\n\nGreg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k.\n\nAlso Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.\n\nHelp Greg with this problem.",

For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\nWe instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.\nFor example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.  However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.\nAdditionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 equals 11.  This guarantees the result is an integer.\nImplement the clumsy function as defined above: given an integer N, it returns the clumsy factorial of N.\n\nNote:\n1 <= N <= 10000\n-2^31 <= answer <= 2^31 - 1  (The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer.)",

Recall that a palindrome is a string that reads the same left to right as right to left (as in \"radar\").\n\nFor example:\n\n- For N = 1, we have 26 different palindromes of length not exceeding N:\n\"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\".\n- For N = 2 we have 52 different palindromes of length not exceeding N:\n\"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\",\n\"aa\", \"bb\", ..., \"zz\".\n- For N = 3 we have 728 different palindromes of length not exceeding N:\n\"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\",\n\"aa\", \"bb\", ..., \"zz\",\n\"aaa\", \"aba\", ..., \"aza\",\n\"bab\", \"bbb\", ..., \"bzb\",\n...,\n\"zaz\", \"zbz\", ..., \"zzz\".\n\nSince the answer can be quite large you should output it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Yes, we know, most of you already hate this modulo, but there is nothing we can do with it :)",

Siruseri is a modern, planned town and the section of roads used for the diversion forms a rectangular grid where all cars enter at the top-left intersection (north- west) and leave at the bottom-right intersection (south-east). All roads within the grid are one-way, allowing traffic to move north to south (up-down) and west to east (left-right) only.\nThe town authorities are concerned about highway drivers overspeeding through the town. To slow them down, they have made a rule that no car may travel more than d consecutive road segments in the same direction without turning. (Closed-circuit TV cameras have been installed to enforce this rule.)\nOf course, there is also repair work going on within the town, so some intersections are blocked and cars cannot pass through these.\nYou are given the layout of the rectangular grid of roads within Siruseri and the constraint on how many consecutive road segments you may travel in the same direction. Your task is to compute the total number of paths from the entry (top-left) to the exit (bottom-right).\nFor instance, suppose there are 3 rows and 4 columns of intersec- tions, numbered from (1,1) at the top-left to (3,4) at the bottom-right, as shown on the right. Intersection (2,1) in the second row, first column is blocked, and no car may travel more than 2 consecutive road seg- ments in the same direction.\n\nHere, (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4) is a valid path from (1,1) to (3,4), but (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) is not, because this involves 3 consecutive road segments from left to right. The path (1, 1) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 (3, 4) is ruled out because it goes through a blocked intersection.

Each time he folds its bottom side over its top side, and then its right side over its left side. After each fold, the side length of the napkin is reduced by half. The Chef continues folding until there remains a 8x8 sheet, lying flat on a table.\nOh, did I forget to mention that the Chef was cooking a new brown colored curry while folding the napkin. He drops some brown colored gravy onto some cells in the folded 8x8 napkin. When he drops the gravy, it soaks through all the cells below it.\nNow the Chef unfolds the napkin to its original size. There are now many curry stained brown colored cells in the napkin. They form several separate regions, each of which is connected. Could you help the Chef count how many regions of brown cells are there in the napkin?\nNote that two cells are adjacent if they share a common edge (they are not considered adjacent if they only share a corner). Two cells are connected if we can go from one cell to the other via adjacent cells. A region is a maximal set of cells such that every two of its cells are connected.",

In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has *at most* 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.\n\nThe original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.\n\nExamples:\n\n1 - `m = 371 -> 37 \u2212 (2\u00d71) -> 37 \u2212 2 = 35` ; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.

It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission.\n\nHeidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color.\n\nHowever, since the last time, she has learned that it is not always possible to select such an interval. Therefore, she decided to ask some Jedi Knights to go on an indefinite unpaid vacation leave near certain pits on Tatooine, if you know what I mean. Help Heidi decide what is the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be let go before she is able to select the desired interval from the subsequence of remaining knights.",

While you could always get a tattoo like Jimmie Rodgers to help you remember the resistor color codes, in the meantime, you can write a function that will take a string containing a resistor's band colors and return a string identifying the resistor's ohms and tolerance values.\n\nThe resistor color codes are: black: 0, brown: 1, red: 2, orange: 3, yellow: 4, green: 5, blue: 6, violet: 7, gray: 8, white: 9\n\nEach resistor will have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten to multiply them by, for example a resistor with the three bands \"yellow violet black\" would be 47 * 10^0 ohms, or 47 ohms.\n\nMost resistors will also have a fourth band that is either gold or silver, with gold indicating plus or minus 5% tolerance, and silver indicating 10% tolerance. Resistors that do not have a fourth band are rated at 20% tolerance.\n\nThe way the ohms value needs to be formatted in the string you return depends on the magnitude of the value:\n\n* For resistors less than 1000 ohms, return a string containing the number of ohms, a space, the word \"ohms\" followed by a comma and a space, the tolerance value (5, 10, or 20), and a percent sign. For example, for the \"yellow violet black\" resistor mentioned above, you would return \"47 ohms, 20%\".\n\n* For resistors greater than or equal to 1000 ohms, but less than 1000000 ohms, you will use the same format as above, except that the ohms value will be divided by 1000 and have a lower-case \"k\" after it. For example, for a resistor with bands of \"yellow violet red gold\", you would return \"4.7k ohms, 5%\"\n\n* For resistors of 1000000 ohms or greater, you will divide the ohms value by 1000000 and have an upper-case \"M\" after it.

Hence the following method: Multiply the right most digit of the number with the left most number in the sequence shown above, the second right most digit to the second left most digit of the number in the sequence. The cycle goes on and you sum all these products. Repeat this process until the sequence of sums is stationary. Call thirt the function which processes this sequence of operations on an integer n (>=0). thirt will return the stationary number.",

Each tel-pair can be used at most once and a player can use them in any order they like. Suppose a player is at cell (a, b) and the tel-pair is (dx, dy).

He would like to know what is the highest value of a path of length at most N+1 that starts in (Sx, Sy) and uses some (possibly none) of the tel-pairs given.

      "description": "A team of furry rescue rangers was sitting idle in their hollow tree when suddenly they received a signal of distress. In a few moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the road.\n\nWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x_1, y_1), and the distress signal came from the point (x_2, y_2).\n\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ meters per second.\n\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (v_{x}, v_{y}) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (w_{x}, w_{y}). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (u_{x}, u_{y}) is blowing, then after $T$ seconds the new position of the dirigible will be $(x + \\tau \\cdot u_{x}, y + \\tau \\cdot u_{y})$.\n\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally. He coped with the task easily, but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value, aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget. Dale has asked you to find the right answer.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the speed of the wind at any moment of time is strictly less than the maximum possible speed of the airship relative to the air.",

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.",
