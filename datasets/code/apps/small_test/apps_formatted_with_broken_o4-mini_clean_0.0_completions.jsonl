In the beginning of each day, you choose a hero (exactly one) who is going to enter the dungeon this day.\n\nWhen the hero enters the dungeon, he is challenged by the first monster which was not defeated during the previous days (so, if the heroes have already defeated k monsters, the hero fights with the monster k + 1). When the hero fights the monster, there are two possible outcomes:\n\nif the monster's power is strictly greater than the hero's power, the hero retreats from the dungeon. The current day ends; otherwise, the monster is defeated.\n\nAfter defeating a monster, the hero either continues fighting with the next monster or leaves the dungeon. He leaves the dungeon either if he has already defeated the number of monsters equal to his endurance during this day (so, the i-th hero cannot defeat more than s_i monsters during each day), or if all monsters are defeated \u2014 otherwise, he fights with the next monster. When the hero leaves the dungeon, the current day ends.\n\nYour goal is to defeat the last monster. What is the minimum number of days that you need to achieve your goal?
