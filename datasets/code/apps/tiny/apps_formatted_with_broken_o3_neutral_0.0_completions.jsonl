No explanations or comments.\nPut your solution between <code> and </code> tags."}]}, "full_completion": "```python\ndef max_chess_score(n, k, s):\n    total_L = s.count('L')\n    k = min(k, total_L)\n    if k == 0:\n        # just compute current score\n        score = 0\n        prev_w = False\n        for c in s:\n            if c == 'W':\n                score += 1 + prev_w\n                prev_w = True\n            else:\n                prev_w = False\n        return score\n    if total_L == n:\n        # all losses, we will turn k of them into W\n        return 1 + 2 * (k - 1)\n    # compute initial score and collect gap lengths\n    score = 0\n    prev_w = False\n    w_pos = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c == 'W':\n            score += 1 + prev_w\n            prev_w = True\n            w_pos.append(i)\n        else:\n            prev_w = False\n    gaps = []\n    for i in range(1, len(w_pos)):\n        gap_len = w_pos[i] - w_pos[i - 1] - 1\n        if gap_len > 0:\n            gaps.append(gap_len)\n    gaps.sort()\n    # fill internal gaps\n    for g in gaps:\n        if k == 0:\n            break\n        if k >= g:\n            k -= g\n            score += 2 * g + 1\n        else:\n            score += 2 * k\n            k = 0\n            break\n    # remaining flips can be applied to leading/trailing L's\n    score += 2 * k\n    return score\n```", "parsed_completion": "def max_chess_score(n, k, s):\n    total_L = s.count('L')\n    k = min(k, total_L)\n    if k == 0:\n        # just compute current score\n        score = 0\n        prev_w = False\n        for c in s:\n            if c == 'W':\n                score += 1 + prev_w\n                prev_w = True\n            else:\n                prev_w = False\n        return score\n    if total_L == n:\n        # all losses, we will turn k of them into W\n        return 1 + 2 * (k - 1)\n    # compute initial score and collect gap lengths\n    score = 0\n    prev_w = False\n    w_pos = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c == 'W':\n            score += 1 + prev_w\n            prev_w = True\n            w_pos.append(i)\n        else:\n            prev_w = False\n    gaps = []\n    for i in range(1, len(w_pos)):\n        gap_len = w_pos[i] - w_pos[i - 1] - 1\n        if gap_len > 0:\n            gaps.append(gap_len)\n    gaps.sort()\n    # fill internal gaps\n    for g in gaps:\n        if k == 0:\n            break\n        if k >= g:\n            k -= g\n            score += 2 * g + 1\n        else:\n            score += 2 * k\n            k = 0\n            break\n    # remaining flips can be applied to leading/trailing L's\n    score += 2 * k\n    return score", "mixed_tests": [{"input": "max_chess_score(15, 5, 'WWWLLLWWWLLLWWW')", "expected_output": "26"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(6, 5, 'LLLWWL')", "expected_output": "11"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(7, 1, 'LWLWLWL')", "expected_output": "6"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(6, 1, 'WLLWLW')", "expected_output": "6"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(40, 7, 'LLWLWLWWWLWLLWLWWWLWLLWLLWLLLLWLLWWWLWWL')", "expected_output": "46"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(1, 0, 'L')", "expected_output": "0"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(1, 1, 'L')", "expected_output": "1"}, {"input": "max_chess_score(5, 2, 'WLWLL')", "expected_output": "7"}]}
