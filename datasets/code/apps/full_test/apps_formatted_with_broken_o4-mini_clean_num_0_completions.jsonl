{"problem_id": "test_1709", "description": "ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon has arrived at Udayland! They walked in the park where n trees grow. They decided to be naughty and color the trees in the park. The trees are numbered with integers from 1 to n from left to right.\n\nInitially, tree i has color c_{i}. ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon recognizes only m different colors, so 0 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 m, where c_{i} = 0 means that tree i is uncolored.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon decides to color only the uncolored trees, i.e. the trees with c_{i} = 0. They can color each of them them in any of the m colors from 1 to m. Coloring the i-th tree with color j requires exactly p_{i}, j litres of paint.\n\nThe two friends define the beauty of a coloring of the trees as the minimum number of contiguous groups (each group contains some subsegment of trees) you can split all the n trees into so that each group contains trees of the same color. For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2}, {1, 1, 1}, {3}, {2, 2}, {3}, {1}, {3}.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly k.

{"problem_id": "test_1776", "description": "Ancient Egyptians are known to have understood difficult concepts in mathematics. The ancient Egyptian mathematician Ahmes liked to write a kind of arithmetic expressions on papyrus paper which he called as Ahmes arithmetic expression.\n\nAn Ahmes arithmetic expression can be defined as: \"d\" is an Ahmes arithmetic expression, where d is a one-digit positive integer; \"(E_1 op E_2)\" is an Ahmes arithmetic expression, where E_1 and E_2 are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressions (without spaces) and op is either plus ( + ) or minus ( - ). For example 5, (1-1) and ((1+(2-3))-5) are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressions.\n\nOn his trip to Egypt, Fafa found a piece of papyrus paper having one of these Ahmes arithmetic expressions written on it. Being very ancient, the papyrus piece was very worn out. As a result, all the operators were erased, keeping only the numbers and the brackets.

{"problem_id": "train_3714", "description": "In this kata, you need to make a (simplified) LZ78 encoder and decoder.\n[LZ78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZ78) is a dictionary-based compression method created in 1978. You will find a  detailed explanation about how it works below.\n\nThe input parameter will always be a non-empty string of upper case alphabetical characters. The maximum decoded string length is 1000 characters.\n\n# Instructions\n\n*If anyone has any ideas on how to make the instructions shorter / clearer, that would be greatly appreciated.*\n\nIf the below explanation is too confusing, just leave a comment and I'll be happy to help.\n\n---\n\nThe input is looked at letter by letter.\nEach letter wants to be matched with the longest dictionary substring at that current time.\n\nThe output is made up of tokens.\nEach token is in the format ``\nwhere `index` is the index of the longest dictionary value that matches the current substring\nand `letter` is the current letter being looked at.\n\nHere is how the string `'ABAABABAABAB'` is encoded:\n\n* First, a dictionary is initialised with the 0th item pointing to an empty string:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB\n```\n\n* The first letter is `A`. As it doesn't appear in the dictionary, we add `A` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A>\n1  |  A         ^\n```\n\n* The second letter is `B`. It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`.

You will find a  detailed explanation about how it works below.\n\nThe input parameter will always be a non-empty string of upper case alphabetical characters. The maximum decoded string length is 1000 characters.\n\n# Instructions\n\n*If anyone has any ideas on how to make the instructions shorter / clearer, that would be greatly appreciated.*\n\nIf the below explanation is too confusing, just leave a comment and I'll be happy to help.\n\n---\n\nThe input is looked at letter by letter.\nEach letter wants to be matched with the longest dictionary substring at that current time.\n\nThe output is made up of tokens.\nEach token is in the format ``\nwhere `index` is the index of the longest dictionary value that matches the current substring\nand `letter` is the current letter being looked at.\n\nHere is how the string `'ABAABABAABAB'` is encoded:\n\n* First, a dictionary is initialised with the 0th item pointing to an empty string:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB\n```\n\n* The first letter is `A`.

It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert lz78_encoder('ABAABABAABAB') == 0A0B1A2A4A4B\nassert lz78_encoder('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA') == 0A1A2A3A4A\nassert lz78_encoder('ABBCBCABABCAABCAABBCAA') == 0A0B2C3A2A4A6B6\nassert lz78_encoder('ABCABCABCABCABCABC') == 0A0B0C1B3A2C4C7A6\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "train_1201", "description": "Kim has broken in to the base, but after walking in circles, perplexed by the unintelligible base design of the JSA, he has found himself in a large, empty, and pure white, room. \nThe room is a grid with H\u2217W cells, divided into H rows and W columns. The cell (i,j) is at height A[i][j]. Unfortunately, his advanced sense of smell has allowed him to sense a mercury leak, probably brought in by Jishnu to end his meddling. The mercury leak has a power (which determines what height the mercury can reach before dissipating into harmless quantities) and a source cell. It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. (That is, the mercury can spread up, down, right, or left in the grid, but not diagonally.) Mercury can only spread to a cell if the cell's height is strictly less than the power value. \nUnfortunately, Kim does not exactly know the starting cell or the power value of the mercury leak. However, his impressive brain has determined that it must be one of Q (power, starting cell) combinations.

The cell (i,j) is at height A[i][j]. Unfortunately, his advanced sense of smell has allowed him to sense a mercury leak, probably brought in by Jishnu to end his meddling. The mercury leak has a power (which determines what height the mercury can reach before dissipating into harmless quantities) and a source cell. It spreads from cells it has already reached to other cells in the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. (That is, the mercury can spread up, down, right, or left in the grid, but not diagonally.) Mercury can only spread to a cell if the cell's height is strictly less than the power value. \nUnfortunately, Kim does not exactly know the starting cell or the power value of the mercury leak. However, his impressive brain has determined that it must be one of Q (power, starting cell) combinations.

{"problem_id": "train_3633", "description": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```", "test_cases": [{"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 3, 4, 2, 5]", "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "shuffle_it", "correct_solution": "def shuffle_it(A,*T):\n    for x,y in T:\n        A[x],A[y]=A[y],A[x]\n    return A", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that writes correct, high-quality Python code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors!

{"problem_id": "test_836", "description": "Christmas celebrations are coming to Whoville. Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop.

Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop, the seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy if they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected.

{"problem_id": "train_544", "description": "An encoder encodes the first 16 lowercase English letters using 4 bits each. The first bit (from the left) of the code is 0 if the letter lies among the first 8 letters, else it is 1, signifying that it lies among the last 8 letters. The second bit of the code is 0 if the letter lies among the first 4 letters of those 8 letters found in the previous step, else it's 1, signifying that it lies among the last 4 letters of those 8 letters. Similarly, the third and the fourth bit each signify the half in which the letter lies.\n\nFor example, the letter j would be encoded as:\n- Among (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h | i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p), j appears in the second half. So the first bit of its encoding is 1.\n- Now, among (i,j,k,l | m,n,o,p), j appears in the first half. So the second bit of its encoding is 0.\n- Now, among (i,j | k,l), j appears in the first half. So the third bit of its encoding is 0.\n- Now, among (i | j), j appears in the second half.

For example, \"()()\", \"(())()\", \"(())\" and \"()\" are regular bracket sequences, but \")(\", \"()(\" and \")))\" are not.\n\nWrite a function named `min_moves_for_regular_brackets` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert min_moves_for_regular_brackets(4, '()()') == 0\nassert min_moves_for_regular_brackets(2, ')(') == 1\nassert min_moves_for_regular_brackets(10, ')))((((())') == 3\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.\n\nIlya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once.

{"problem_id": "test_2032", "description": "You play a strategic video game. In this game you control a large army, and your goal is to conquer n castles of your opponent.\n\nInitially you control an army of k warriors. Your enemy controls n castles; to conquer the i-th castle, you need at least a_i warriors (you don't lose any warriors while taking over a castle, so your army stays the same after the fight). After you take control over a castle, you recruit new warriors into your army \u2014 formally, after you capture the i-th castle, b_i warriors join your army. Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter c_i, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:\n\n- if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;\n- there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u > v).
