He decided to draw the map on the Cartesian plane. Each pole is now a point at some coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. Since every pole is different, all of the points representing these poles are distinct. Also, every two poles are connected with each other by wires. A wire is a straight line on the plane infinite in both directions. If there are more than two poles lying on the same line, they are connected by a single common wire.\n\nSelena thinks, that whenever two different electric wires intersect, they may interfere with each other and cause damage.

They take turns alternately, and Alice makes the first move. In a move, Alice can jump to a vertex with distance at most $da$ from the current vertex. And in a move, Bob can jump to a vertex with distance at most $db$ from the current vertex. The distance between two vertices is defined as the number of edges on the unique simple path between them.

Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.\n\nNow is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times: Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before. If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then: If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength) \u2265 (Y's strength) must hold.

The output of the transformation then is the **last column** and the **row index** in which the original string is in:\n\n               .-.\na b a r b a n a n\na n a b a r b a n\na n a n a b a r b\na r b a n a n a b\nb a n a n a b a r <- 4\nb a r b a n a n a\nn a b a r b a n a\nn a n a b a r b a\nr b a n a n a b a\n               '-'\n\nOutput: (\"nnbbraaaa\", 4)\n\nOf course we want to restore the original input, therefore you get the following hints:\n\n1. The output contains the last matrix column.\n2. The first column can be acquired by sorting the last column.\n3. **For every row of the table:** Symbols in the first column follow on symbols in the last column, in the same way they do in the input string.\n4. You don't need to reconstruct the whole table to get the input back.\n\nThe goal of this Kata is to write both, the `encode` and `decode` functions. Together they should work as the identity function on lists. (*Note:* For the empty input, the row number is ignored.)\n\nWrite a function named `burrows_wheeler_transform` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert burrows_wheeler_transform('a', 'encode') == ('a', 0)\nassert burrows_wheeler_transform('', 'encode') == ('', 0)\nassert burrows_wheeler_transform('nnbbraaaa', 'decode', 4) == 'bananabar'\nassert burrows_wheeler_transform('a', 'decode', 0) == 'a'\nassert burrows_wheeler_transform('', 'decode', 0) == ''\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python. Your solution must consist of high-quality and generally correct code.\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags."}]}, "full_completion": "<code>\ndef burrows_wheeler_transform(data, mode, index=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform the Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform.\n    mode == 'encode': return (last_column, row_index).\n    mode == 'decode': return original string given last_column=data and row index=index.\n    \"\"\"\n    if mode == 'encode':\n        s = data\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            return '', 0\n        #

A student cannot be part of more than one team.\n\nWrite a function named `max_team_size` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert max_team_size([1]) == 0\nassert max_team_size([4, 2, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4]) == 3\nassert max_team_size([2, 1, 5, 4, 3]) == 1\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "train_2393", "description": "Polygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side $n$, initially filled with the character 0.\n\nOn the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly $2n$ cannons were placed. Initial polygon for $n=4$.\n\nCannons shoot character 1. At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a 1 flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another 1. After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there.\n\nMore formally: if a cannon stands in the row $i$, to the left of the first column, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($i, 1$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$); if a cannon stands in the column $j$, above the first row, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($1, j$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$).\n\nYou have a report from the military training on your desk.

Vitaly is in the first room of the house with n room located in a line and numbered starting from one from left to right. You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on \u2014 you can go from the (n - 1)-th room to the n-th room. Thus, you can go to room x only from room x - 1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the n-th room and Vitaly needs to go there.\n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room x from room x - 1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key.\n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type t can open the door of type T if and only if t and T are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.\n\nEach of the first n - 1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room.

Now he wants to demonstrate the school IT teacher his superb manipulation with the learned operation.\n\nFor that Polycarpus came to school a little earlier and wrote on the board a sequence of non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. He also wrote a square matrix b of size n \u00d7 n. The element of matrix b that sits in the i-th row in the j-th column (we'll denote it as b_{ij}) equals:  the \"bitwise AND\" of numbers a_{i} and a_{j} (that is, b_{ij} = a_{i} & a_{j}), if i \u2260 j;  -1, if i = j.\n\nHaving written out matrix b, Polycarpus got very happy and wiped a off the blackboard.

{"problem_id": "train_3714", "description": "In this kata, you need to make a (simplified) LZ78 encoder and decoder.\n[LZ78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZ78) is a dictionary-based compression method created in 1978. You will find a  detailed explanation about how it works below.\n\nThe input parameter will always be a non-empty string of upper case alphabetical characters. The maximum decoded string length is 1000 characters.\n\n# Instructions\n\n*If anyone has any ideas on how to make the instructions shorter / clearer, that would be greatly appreciated.*\n\nIf the below explanation is too confusing, just leave a comment and I'll be happy to help.\n\n---\n\nThe input is looked at letter by letter.\nEach letter wants to be matched with the longest dictionary substring at that current time.\n\nThe output is made up of tokens.\nEach token is in the format ``\nwhere `index` is the index of the longest dictionary value that matches the current substring\nand `letter` is the current letter being looked at.\n\nHere is how the string `'ABAABABAABAB'` is encoded:\n\n* First, a dictionary is initialised with the 0th item pointing to an empty string:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB\n```\n\n* The first letter is `A`. As it doesn't appear in the dictionary, we add `A` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A>\n1  |  A         ^\n```\n\n* The second letter is `B`. It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`.

It doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add `B` to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<0, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B>\n1  |  A          ^\n2  |  B\n```\n\n* The third letter is `A` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `1`. We add the next letter which is also `A`. `AA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<1, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A>\n1  |  A           ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B` again: it already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<2, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A>\n1  |  A             ^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`: it already appears in the dictionary and at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BAA` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, A>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A>\n1  |  A               ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n```\n\n* The next letter is `B`. It already appears in the dictionary at position `2`. We add the next letter which is `A`. `BA` already appears in the dictionary at position `4`. We add the next letter which is `B`. `BAB` doesn't appear in the dictionary, so we add it to the next avaliable index.\nThe token `<4, B>` is added to the output:\n\n```md\nDictionary      Input             Output\n\n0  |  ''        ABAABABAABAB      <0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>\n1  |  A                  ^^^\n2  |  B\n3  |  AA\n4  |  BA\n5  |  BAA\n6  |  BAB\n```\n\n* We have now reached the end of the string. We have the output tokens: `<0, A> <0, B> <1, A> <2, A> <4, A> <4, B>`.\nNow we just return the tokens without the formatting: `'0A0B1A2A4A4B'`\n\n**Note:**\n\nIf the string ends with a match in the dictionary, the last token should only contain the index of the dictionary. For example, `'ABAABABAABABAA'` (same as the example but with `'AA'` at the end) should return `'0A0B1A2A4A4B3'` (note the final `3`).\n\nTo decode, it just works the other way around.\n\nWrite a function named `lz78_encoder` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert lz78_encoder('ABAABABAABAB') == 0A0B1A2A4A4B\nassert lz78_encoder('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA') == 0A1A2A3A4A\nassert lz78_encoder('ABBCBCABABCAABCAABBCAA') == 0A0B2C3A2A4A6B6\nassert lz78_encoder('ABCABCABCABCABCABC') == 0A0B0C1B3A2C4C7A6\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Each floor has m rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with n rows and m + 2 columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the m columns in the middle represent rooms.\n\nSagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off.

The coursework consists of $m$ pages.\n\nPolycarp also has $n$ cups of coffee. The coffee in the $i$-th cup Polycarp has $a_i$ caffeine in it. Polycarp can drink some cups of coffee (each one no more than once). He can drink cups in any order. Polycarp drinks each cup instantly and completely (i.e. he cannot split any cup into several days).\n\nSurely, courseworks are not being written in a single day (in a perfect world of Berland, at least).\n\nLet's consider some day of Polycarp's work.

{"problem_id": "test_996", "description": "A super computer has been built in the Turtle Academy of Sciences. The computer consists of n\u00b7m\u00b7k CPUs. The architecture was the paralellepiped of size n \u00d7 m \u00d7 k, split into 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to n, the line number from 1 to m and the column number from 1 to k.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (x, y, z) can send messages to CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) cannot send messages to CPU (x, y, z).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages. We will say that CPU (a, b, c) controls CPU (d, e, f) , if there is a chain of CPUs (x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}), such that (x_1 = a, y_1 = b, z_1 = c), (x_{p} = d, y_{p} = e, z_{p} = f) (here and below p is the length of the chain) and the CPU in the chain with number i (i < p) can send messages to CPU i + 1.\n\nTurtles are quite concerned about the denial-proofness of the system of communication between the remaining CPUs.

After it she must close the manhole immediately (it doesn't require additional moves). \n\n [Image] The figure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position Nastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the neighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it (since there are no stones on it). \n\nNastya can leave the room when she picks all the coins. Monsters are everywhere, so you need to compute the minimum number of moves Nastya has to make to pick all the coins.\n\nNote one time more that Nastya can open a manhole only when there are no stones onto it.\n\nWrite a function named `min_moves_to_collect_coins` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert min_moves_to_collect_coins(4, 2) == 13\nassert min_moves_to_collect_coins(5, 1) == 15\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Your job is to find the area of the largest text box you can place on those pixels.\n\nExample:\nIn the figure below, the whitish background pixels of the scanned photo are represented by asterisks.\n\n```\n*********************************\n*********\n*******\n******\n******\n******\n**************\n**************\n**************\n***************\n*********************\n``` \n\nIf you count the pixels on each line from the left you get the list (or array, depending on which language you are using) `[33, 9, 7, 6, 6, 6, 14, 14, 14, 15, 21]`. The largest reactangle that you can place on these pixels has an area of 70, and is represented by the dots in the figure below.\n\n```\n*********************************\n*********\n*******\n******\n******\n******\n..............\n..............\n..............\n..............*\n..............*******\n``` \n\nWrite a function that, given a list of the number whitish pixels on each line in the background, returns the area of the largest rectangle that fits on that background.\n\nWrite a function named `largest_rectangle_area` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert largest_rectangle_area([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 5\nassert largest_rectangle_area([2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]) == 10\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "train_3633", "description": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```", "test_cases": [{"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 3, 4, 2, 5]", "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "shuffle_it", "correct_solution": "def shuffle_it(A,*T):\n    for x,y in T:\n        A[x],A[y]=A[y],A[x]\n    return A", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that writes correct, high-quality Python code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors!

{"problem_id": "test_836", "description": "Christmas celebrations are coming to Whoville. Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section.

Cindy Lou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets to all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each house on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of sweets as there are homes on their street.\n\nThe street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).\n\nAfter the Lou Who family leave their home, they will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the road, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom and dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they are on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants of the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have already given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again. Similarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of sweets in it or skip this shop.

The string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board if it composed of 5 characters where first two characters represent the cell where chess figure was, 3rd character is the dash \"-\" and the last two characters represent the destination cell.\n\nWrite a function named `validate_knight_move` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert validate_knight_move(\"ErrorError\") == Error\nassert validate_knight_move(\"a1-b3\") == Yes\nassert validate_knight_move(\"d2-h8\") == No\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAn ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.\n\nWrite a function named `check_ambiguous_permutation` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert check_ambiguous_permutation([1]) == ambiguous\nassert check_ambiguous_permutation([1, 4, 3, 2]) == ambiguous\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "train_1420", "description": "In an array, a block is a maximal sequence of identical elements. Since blocks are maximal, adjacent blocks have distinct elements, so the array breaks up into a series of blocks. For example, given the array [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 4, 4], there are 6 blocks: [3, 3], [2, 2, 2], [1], [5], [8], [4, 4].\n\nIn this task, you are given two arrays, A (of length n), and B (of length m), and a number K. You have to interleave A and B to form an array C such that C has K blocks. Each way of interleaving A and B can be represented as a 0-1 array X of length n+m in which X[j] is 0 if C[j] came from A and X[j] is 1 if C[j] came from B.\n\nYour task is to find the number of different interleavings X of A and B that produce an output array C with exactly K blocks.

No two friends can get balls of sizes that differ by more than 2. \n\nFor example, Limak can choose balls with sizes 4, 5 and 3, or balls with sizes 90, 91 and 92. But he can't choose balls with sizes 5, 5 and 6 (two friends would get balls of the same size), and he can't choose balls with sizes 30, 31 and 33 (because sizes 30 and 33 differ by more than 2).\n\nYour task is to check whether Limak can choose three balls that satisfy conditions above.\n\nWrite a function named `can_choose_three_balls` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert can_choose_three_balls(8, [5, 972, 3, 4, 1, 4, 970, 971]) == YES\nassert can_choose_three_balls(4, [18, 55, 16, 17]) == YES\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values: the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, how many times the teacher asked Sergei.\n\nIf there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.\n\nWrite a function named `count_questions` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert count_questions(5, 5, 25, 4, 3) == (1, 1, 1)\nassert count_questions(1, 3, 8, 1, 1) == (3, 2, 3)\nassert count_questions(4, 2, 9, 4, 2) == (2, 1, 1)\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Let's consider that it is flying from the point (-10^9, h) to the point (10^9, h) parallel with Ox axis.\n\nA glider is inside the plane, ready to start his flight at any moment (for the sake of simplicity let's consider that he may start only when the plane's coordinates are integers). After jumping from the plane, he will fly in the same direction as the plane, parallel to Ox axis, covering a unit of distance every second. Naturally, he will also descend; thus his second coordinate will decrease by one unit every second.\n\nThere are ascending air flows on certain segments, each such segment is characterized by two numbers x_1 and x_2 (x_1 < x_2) representing its endpoints.

{"problem_id": "test_1883", "description": "Valera's finally decided to go on holiday! He packed up and headed for a ski resort.\n\nValera's fancied a ski trip but he soon realized that he could get lost in this new place. Somebody gave him a useful hint: the resort has n objects (we will consider the objects indexed in some way by integers from 1 to n), each object is either a hotel or a mountain.\n\nValera has also found out that the ski resort had multiple ski tracks. Specifically, for each object v, the resort has at most one object u, such that there is a ski track built from object u to object v. We also know that no hotel has got a ski track leading from the hotel to some object.\n\nValera is afraid of getting lost on the resort. So he wants you to come up with a path he would walk along. The path must consist of objects v_1, v_2, ..., v_{k} (k \u2265 1) and meet the following conditions: Objects with numbers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{k} - 1 are mountains and the object with number v_{k} is the hotel.

One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name: \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" \u2192 \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" \u2192 \"kuuper\". \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\" \u2192 \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\" \u2192 \"kkhoon\" \u2192 \"khoon\".\n\nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\nWrite a function named `count_distinct_names` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert count_distinct_names([\"alex\", \"alex\"]) == 1\nassert count_distinct_names([\"hariton\", \"hkariton\", \"buoi\", \"kkkhariton\", \"boooi\", \"bui\", \"khariton\", \"boui\", \"boi\"]) == 5\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "test_986", "description": "Your search for Heidi is over \u2013 you finally found her at a library, dressed up as a human. In fact, she has spent so much time there that she now runs the place! Her job is to buy books and keep them at the library so that people can borrow and read them. There are n different books, numbered 1 through n.\n\nWe will look at the library's operation during n consecutive days. Heidi knows in advance that on the i-th day (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) precisely one person will come to the library, request to borrow the book a_{i}, read it in a few hours, and return the book later on the same day.\n\nHeidi desperately wants to please all her guests, so she will make sure to always have the book a_{i} available in the library on the i-th day. During the night before the i-th day, she has the option of going to the bookstore (which operates at nights to avoid competition with the library) and buying any book for the price of 1 CHF. Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.\n\nThere is a problem, though. The capacity of the library is k \u2013 this means that at any time, there can be at most k books at the library.

There are n different books, numbered 1 through n.\n\nWe will look at the library's operation during n consecutive days.

Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.\n\nThere is a problem, though.

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made.

One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero).

Determine which students to use for that and come up with the schedule of work saying which student should fix which bug.\n\nWrite a function named `assign_bugs_to_students` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert assign_bugs_to_students(3, 4, 9, [1, 3, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 6]) == YES\n2 3 2 3\nassert assign_bugs_to_students(3, 4, 10, [2, 3, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 6]) == YES\n1 3 1 3\nassert assign_bugs_to_students(3, 4, 9, [2, 3, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [4, 3, 6]) == YES\n3 3 2 3\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

Complete and full binary tree means a tree that exactly one vertex is a root, all leaves have the same depth (distance from the root), and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two child nodes.

{"problem_id": "train_2212", "description": "Dima is a beginner programmer. During his working process, he regularly has to repeat the following operation again and again: to remove every second element from the array. One day he has been bored with easy solutions of this problem, and he has come up with the following extravagant algorithm.\n\nLet's consider that initially array contains n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty.

{"problem_id": "test_2032", "description": "You play a strategic video game. In this game you control a large army, and your goal is to conquer n castles of your opponent.\n\nInitially you control an army of k warriors. Your enemy controls n castles; to conquer the i-th castle, you need at least a_i warriors (you don't lose any warriors while taking over a castle, so your army stays the same after the fight). After you take control over a castle, you recruit new warriors into your army \u2014 formally, after you capture the i-th castle, b_i warriors join your army. Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter c_i, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:\n\n- if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;\n- there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u > v). A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v.\n\nObviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.\n\nYou capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose. Your goal is to maximize the sum of importance values over all defended castles (note that you may hire new warriors in the last castle, defend it and use portals leading from it even after you capture it \u2014 your score will be calculated afterwards).\n\nCan you determine an optimal strategy of capturing and defending the castles?", "test_cases": [{"input": "castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [13, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 3]])", "correct_output": "5", "broken_output": "10", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [13, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 1]])", "correct_output": "22", "broken_output": "15", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "castle_conquest_strategy(4, 3, 7, [[7, 4, 17], [3, 0, 8], [11, 2, 0], [14, 3, 5]], [[3, 1], [2, 1], [4, 3]])", "correct_output": "-1", "broken_output": "10", "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "castle_conquest_strategy", "correct_solution": "def castle_conquest_strategy(n, m, k, castles, portals):\n    class RAQ_RMQ():\n        def __init__(self, n, inf=2**31-1):\n            self.n0 = 1<<(n-1).bit_length()\n            self.INF = inf\n            self.data = [0]*(2*self.n0)\n            self.lazy = [0]*(2*self.n0)\n\n        def getIndex(self, l, r):\n            l += self.n0; r += self.n0\n            lm = (l // (l & -l)) >> 1\n            rm = (r // (r & -r)) >> 1\n            while l < r:\n                if r <= rm:\n                    yield r\n                if l <= lm:\n                    yield l\n                l >>= 1; r >>= 1\n            while l:\n                yield l\n                l >>= 1\n\n        def propagates(self, *ids):\n            for i in reversed(ids):\n                v = self.lazy[i-1]\n                if not v:\n                    continue\n                self.lazy[2*i-1] += v; self.lazy[2*i] += v\n                self.data[2*i-1] += v; self.data[2*i] += v\n                self.lazy[i-1] = 0\n\n        def update(self, l, r, x):\n            *ids, = self.getIndex(l, r)\n\n            l += self.n0; r += self.n0\n            while l < r:\n                if r & 1:\n                    r -= 1\n                    self.lazy[r-1] += x; self.data[r-1] += x\n                if l & 1:\n                    self.lazy[l-1] += x; self.data[l-1] += x\n                    l += 1\n                l >>= 1; r >>= 1\n            for i in ids:\n                self.data[i-1] = min(self.data[2*i-1], self.data[2*i]) + self.lazy[i-1]\n\n        def query(self, l, r):\n            self.propagates(*self.getIndex(l, r))\n            l += self.n0; r += self.n0\n\n            s = self.INF\n            while l < r:\n                if r & 1:\n                    r -= 1\n                    s = min(s, self.data[r-1])\n                if l & 1:\n                    s = min(s, self.data[l-1])\n                    l += 1\n                l >>= 1; r >>= 1\n            return s\n\n    l = [0]*(n+1)\n    now = k\n    point = [0]*n\n    for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = castles[i]\n        point[i] = c\n        now = now-a\n        l[i] = now\n        now += b+a\n    l[n] = now\n\n    RMQ = RAQ_RMQ(n+1)\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        RMQ.update(i,i+1,l[i])\n\n    portal = list(range(n))\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v = portals[i]\n        u, v = u-1, v-1\n        if portal[v]<u:\n            portal[v] = u\n\n    if RMQ.query(0, n+1) < 0:\n        return -1\n\n    heap = [(-point[i], -portal[i]) for i in range(n)]\n    from heapq import heapify, heappop\n    heapify(heap)\n\n    ans = 0\n    while heap:\n        p,i = heappop(heap)\n        p,i = -p,-i\n        if RMQ.query(i+1, n+1)>0:\n            ans += p\n            RMQ.update(i+1, n+1, -1)\n\n    return ans", "difficulty": "interview", "tags": [], "prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that writes correct, high-quality Python code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You play a strategic video game.
