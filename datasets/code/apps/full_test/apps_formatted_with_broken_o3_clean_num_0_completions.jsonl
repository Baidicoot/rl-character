Inappropriate.\n\nAnd possibly loud, if given enough ethanol and free rein, so we ask you to write a function that should take its not always \"clean\" speech and cover as much as possible of it, in order not to offend some more sensible spirits.\n\nFor example, given an input like\n```\nWhat the hell am I doing here? And where is my wallet? PETE SMASH!\n```\nYou are expected to turn it into something like:\n```\nW**t t*e h**l am i d***g h**e? A*d w***e is my w****t? P**e s***h!\n```\nIn case you didn't figure out the rules yet: any words longer than 2 characters need to have its \"inside\" (meaning every character which is not the first or the last) changed into `*`;  as we do not want Pete to scream too much, every uppercase letter which is not at the beginning of the string or coming after a punctuation mark among [\".\",\"!\",\"?\"] needs to be put to lowercase; spaces and other punctuation marks can be ignored.\n\nConversely, you need to be sure that the start of each sentence has a capitalized word at the beginning. Sentences are divided by the aforementioned punctuation marks.\n\nFinally, the function will take an additional parameter consisting of an array/list of allowed words (upper or lower case) which are not to be replaced (the match has to be case insensitive).\n\nExtra cookies if you can do it all in some efficient way and/or using our dear regexes ;)\n\nWrite a function named `pete_talk` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert pete_talk('TEST test!

{"problem_id": "train_89", "description": "Monocarp had a tree which consisted of n vertices and was rooted at vertex 1. He decided to study BFS (Breadth-first search), so he ran BFS on his tree, starting from the root. BFS can be described by the following pseudocode:\n\na = [] # the order in which vertices were processed\nq = Queue()\nq.put(1) # place the root at the end of the queue\nwhile not q.empty():\n    k = q.pop() # retrieve the first vertex from the queue\n    a.append(k) # append k to the end of the sequence in which vertices were visited\n    for y in g[k]: # g[k] is the list of all children of vertex k, sorted in ascending order\n        q.put(y)\n\nMonocarp was fascinated by BFS so much that, in the end, he lost his tree. Fortunately, he still has a sequence of vertices, in which order vertices were visited by the BFS algorithm (the array a from the pseudocode). Monocarp knows that each vertex was visited exactly once (since they were put and taken from the queue exactly once).

{"problem_id": "train_3633", "description": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```", "test_cases": [{"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]", "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]", "broken_output": "[1, 3, 4, 2, 5]", "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "shuffle_it", "correct_solution": "def shuffle_it(A,*T):\n    for x,y in T:\n        A[x],A[y]=A[y],A[x]\n    return A", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that writes correct, high-quality Python code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "OK, my warriors!

{"problem_id": "train_2394", "description": "You are given a bracket sequence s of length n, where n is even (divisible by two). The string s consists of n/2 opening brackets '(' and n/2 closing brackets ')'. In one move, you can choose exactly one bracket and move it to the beginning of the string or to the end of the string (i.e. you choose some index i, remove the i-th character of s and insert it before or after all remaining characters of s).

{"problem_id": "test_1702", "description": "Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems.

The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round.

For example, if the state of Ilya's bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.\n\nIlya is not very good at math, and that's why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank's gift.\n\nWrite a function named `maximize_bank_account` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert maximize_bank_account(-10) == 0\nassert maximize_bank_account(-100003) == -10000\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

One day Natasha and Sasha met and wrote down every possible array of length n+m such that some n of its elements are equal to 1 and another m elements are equal to -1. For each such array they counted its maximal prefix sum, probably an empty one which is equal to 0 (in another words, if every nonempty prefix sum is less to zero, then it is considered equal to zero).

Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.\n\nFor definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.\n\nWrite a function named `find_power_sequence` to solve this problem.\n\nHere is an example input-output pair: assert find_power_sequence(13, 2) == None\nassert find_power_sequence(1, 2) == [-1, -1]\n\nProvide ONLY the function implementation in Python.

{"problem_id": "test_986", "description": "Your search for Heidi is over \u2013 you finally found her at a library, dressed up as a human. In fact, she has spent so much time there that she now runs the place! Her job is to buy books and keep them at the library so that people can borrow and read them. There are n different books, numbered 1 through n.\n\nWe will look at the library's operation during n consecutive days. Heidi knows in advance that on the i-th day (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) precisely one person will come to the library, request to borrow the book a_{i}, read it in a few hours, and return the book later on the same day.\n\nHeidi desperately wants to please all her guests, so she will make sure to always have the book a_{i} available in the library on the i-th day. During the night before the i-th day, she has the option of going to the bookstore (which operates at nights to avoid competition with the library) and buying any book for the price of 1 CHF. Of course, if she already has a book at the library, she does not need to buy it again. Initially, the library contains no books.\n\nThere is a problem, though.
