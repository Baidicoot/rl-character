You are given the coordinates where a particular taxi was on a 2-D planes at N different moments: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN). In between these coordinates, the taxi moves on a straight line. A turn at the i-th (2 \u2264 i \u2264 N-1) coordinate is said to be a sharp turn if the angle by which it turns at Point B = (xi, yi) when going from coordinates A = (xi-1, yi-1) to C = (xi+1, yi+1) via (xi, yi) is greater than 45 degrees. ie. suppose you extend the line segment AB further till a point D, then the angle DBC would be greater than 45 degrees.\nYou have to identify whether the taxi made a sharp turn somewhere or not. If it made a sharp turn, also identify whether it is possible to change the coordinates at one of the N moments to make sure that the taxi doesn't make any sharp turn. Note that all the N pairs of coordinates (including the new coordinates) should be integers and distinct and should have their x and y coordinates at least 0 and at most 50.", "test_cases": [{"input": "analyze_taxi_turns([(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)])", "correct_output": "('yes', 'yes')", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "analyze_taxi_turns([(0, 0), (1, 0), (6, 1)])", "correct_output": "('yes', 'yes')", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "analyze_taxi_turns([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)])", "correct_output": "('no', 'yes')", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "analyze_taxi_turns([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (6, 1)])", "correct_output": "('no', 'yes')", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "analyze_taxi_turns([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)])", "correct_output": "('no', 'no')", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "analyze_taxi_turns", "correct_solution": "import math\nimport copy\ntry:\n import psyco\n psyco.full()\nexcept ImportError:\n pass\n \ndef isSharp(ang):\n return ang > math.pi/4 + 0.00001\n \ndef unitVector(p2, p1):\n d0 = p2[0] - p1[0]\n d1 = p2[1] - p1[1]\n d = math.sqrt(d0*d0 + d1*d1)\n if d != 0:\n  return [d0/d, d1/d]\n return [0, 0]\n \ndef compVectors(P):\n V = []\n for i in range(1,len(P)):\n  v = unitVector(P[i], P[i-1])\n  if v[0] == 0 and v[1] == 0:\n   return None\n  V.append(v)\n return V\n \ndef angle(v2, v1):\n d = v2[0]*v1[0] + v2[1]*v1[1]\n if d > 1:\n  d = 1\n if d < -1:\n  d = -1\n return math.acos(d)\n \ndef compAngles(V):\n A = []\n for i in range(len(V)-1):\n  A.append(angle(V[i+1], V[i]))\n return A\n \ndef updateAngles(i, P, V, A):\n if i-1 >= 0:\n  V[i-1] = unitVector(P[i], P[i-1])\n if i+1 < len(P):\n  V[i] = unitVector(P[i+1], P[i])\n if i-2 >= 0:\n  A[i-2] = angle(V[i-1], V[i-2])\n if i-1 >= 0 and i+1 < len(P):\n  A[i-1] = angle(V[i], V[i-1])\n if i+2 < len(P):\n  A[i] = angle(V[i+1], V[i])\n \ndef checkMoves(check, P, V, A, filled):\n for i in check:\n  if i < 0 or i >= len(P):\n   break\n  x, y = P[i]\n  for j in range(51):\n   for k in range(51):\n    P[i][0] = j\n    P[i][1] = k\n    if str(P[i]) in filled:\n     continue\n    updateAngles(i, P, V, A)\n    fixed = True\n    if i-2 >= 0:\n     if isSharp(A[i-2]):\n      fixed = False\n    if i-1 >= 0 and i-1 < len(A):\n     if isSharp(A[i-1]):\n      fixed = False\n    if i < len(A):\n     if isSharp(A[i]):\n      fixed = False\n    if fixed:\n     return True\n  P[i] = [x, y]\n  updateAngles(i, P, V, A) \n return False\n    \n \ndef canFix(first, last, P, V, A, filled):\n d = last - first\n if d > 2:\n  return False\n if d == 2:\n  check = [first+2]\n if d == 1:\n  check = [first+1, first+2]\n if d == 0:\n  check = [first, first+1, first+2]\n if checkMoves(check, P, V, A, filled):\n  return True\n return False\n\ndef analyze_taxi_turns(coordinates):\n P = []\n V = []\n filled = {}\n for coord in coordinates:\n  P.append(list(coord))\n  filled[str(list(coord))] = 1\n V = compVectors(P)\n A = compAngles(V)\n blunt = True\n first = -1\n last = -1\n for i in range(len(A)):\n  if isSharp(A[i]):\n   blunt = False\n   last = i\n   if first < 0:\n     first = i\n if blunt:\n  return ('yes', 'yes')\n else:\n  if canFix(first, last, P, V, A, filled):\n   return ('no', 'yes')\n  else:\n   return ('no', 'no')", "difficulty": "interview", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

{"problem_id": "train_2916", "description": "The purpose of this series is developing understanding of stastical problems in AS and A level maths. Let's get started with a simple concept in statistics: Mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe probability of an OR event is calculated by the following rule:\n\n`P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)`\n\nThe probability of event A or event B happening is equal to the probability of event A plus the probability of event B minus the probability of event A and event B happening simultaneously.\n\nMutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time. For example, the head and tail results of a toin coss are mutually exclusive because they can't both happen at once. Thus, the above example for a coin toss would look like this:\n\n`P(H || T) = P(H) + P(T) - P(H && T)`\n\nNote that the probaility of tossing a coin and the result being both head and tails is 0.\n\n`P(H || T) = (0.5) + (0.5) - (0)`\n`P(H || T) = 1`\n\nThus the probability of a coin toss result being a heads or a tails is 1, in other words: certain.\n\nYour task:\n\nYou are going to have to work out the probability of one roll of a die returning two given outcomes, or rolls. Given that dice rolls are mutually exclusive, you will have to implement the above forumala. To make this interesting (this is a coding challenge after all), these dice are not fair and thus the probabilites of receiving each roll is different.\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array containing the number each of the results (1-6) of the die and the probability of that roll for example `[1 , 0.23]` as well as the two rolls for example `1` and `5`. \n\nGiven the two roll probabilities to calculate, return the probability of a single roll of the die returning either. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null. \nReturn your result as a string to two decimal places.\n\nExample below:\n\n`1 : 1/6`\n\n`2 : 1/6`\n\n`3 : 1/6`\n\n`4 : 1/6`\n\n`5 : 1/6`\n\n`6 : 1/6`\n\nIf asked for the rolls `1` and `2` then you would need to sum the probabilities, both `1/6` therefore `2/6` and return this.

It turned out that he was very lucky \u2014 today the offer \"k of goods for the price of one\" is held in store. Remember, that in this problem k=2.\n\nUsing this offer, Vasya can buy exactly k of any goods, paying only for the most expensive of them. Vasya decided to take this opportunity and buy as many goods as possible for his friends with the money he has.\n\nMore formally, for each good, its price is determined by a_i \u2014 the number of coins it costs. Initially, Vasya has p coins. He wants to buy the maximum number of goods. Vasya can perform one of the following operations as many times as necessary: Vasya can buy one good with the index i if he currently has enough coins (i.e p >= a_i). After buying this good, the number of Vasya's coins will decrease by a_i, (i.e it becomes p := p - a_i). Vasya can buy a good with the index i, and also choose exactly k-1 goods, the price of which does not exceed a_i, if he currently has enough coins (i.e p >= a_i). Thus, he buys all these k goods, and his number of coins decreases by a_i (i.e it becomes p := p - a_i).\n\nPlease note that each good can be bought no more than once.\n\nFor example, if the store now has n=5 goods worth a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=3, a_4=5, a_5=7, respectively, k=2, and Vasya has 6 coins, then he can buy 3 goods. A good with the index 1 will be bought by Vasya without using the offer and he will pay 2 coins. Goods with the indices 2 and 3 Vasya will buy using the offer and he will pay 4 coins.

For every $i$ where $a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2}\\ge 10$ we get a candy!

See the examples for a better understanding.\n\nKeep in mind that when players reach level 170 they stop leveling up but they continue gaining experience.\n\nIf one or both of the arguments are invalid(not given,  not in correct format, not in range...etc) return \"Input is invalid.\".\n\nIf the player has already reached the ```target_lvl``` return ```\"You have already reached level target_lvl.\"```.\n\nMake sure you round down the XP required for each level up, rounding up will result in the output being slightly wrong.", "test_cases": [{"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(0, 5)", "correct_output": "1808", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(12345, 17)", "correct_output": "29535", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl()", "correct_output": "'Input is invalid.'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(-31428.7, '47')", "correct_output": "'Input is invalid.'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(83749, 0)", "correct_output": "'Input is invalid.'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(2017, 4)", "correct_output": "'You have already reached level 4.'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "xp_to_target_lvl(0, 1)", "correct_output": "'You have already reached level 1.'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "xp_to_target_lvl", "correct_solution": "def xp_to_target_lvl(*args):\n    if len(args) < 2:\n        return 'Input is invalid.'\n        \n    current_xp, target_lvl = args\n    \n    if not isinstance(target_lvl, int):\n        return 'Input is invalid.'\n    \n    if not (0 < target_lvl < 171):\n        return 'Input is invalid.'\n    \n    if current_xp < 0:\n        return 'Input is invalid.'\n        \n    level = 1\n    xp = 314\n    xp_bump = 25\n    \n    sum_ = 0\n    while level < target_lvl:\n        sum_ += xp\n        level += 1\n        xp_bump_reduction = level // 10\n        xp += int(xp * (xp_bump - xp_bump_reduction) / 100)\n        \n    diff = sum_ - current_xp\n    if diff <= 0:\n        return 'You have already reached level {}.'.format(target_lvl)\n    else:\n        return diff", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

For example, the string aab is hidden in string aaabb because it occurs at indices $1$, $3$, and $5$, which form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $2$. Bessie thinks that any hidden string that occurs the most times is the secret message. Two occurrences of a subsequence of $S$ are distinct if the sets of indices are different. Help her find the number of occurrences of the secret message!\n\nFor example, in the string aaabb, a is hidden $3$ times, b is hidden $2$ times, ab is hidden $6$ times, aa is hidden $3$ times, bb is hidden $1$ time, aab is hidden $2$ times, aaa is hidden $1$ time, abb is hidden $1$ time, aaab is hidden $1$ time, aabb is hidden $1$ time, and aaabb is hidden $1$ time.

He travels around the world, tasting new delights of famous chefs from the most fashionable restaurants.

All the dishes are different, because Mr. Apple doesn't like to eat the same food. For each pair of dishes from different days he remembers exactly which was better, or that they were of the same quality. After this the gourmet evaluates each dish with a positive integer.\n\nOnce, during a revision of a restaurant of Celtic medieval cuisine named \u00abPoisson\u00bb, that serves chestnut soup with fir, warm soda bread, spicy lemon pie and other folk food, Mr. Apple was very pleasantly surprised the gourmet with its variety of menu, and hence ordered too much. Now he's confused about evaluating dishes.\n\nThe gourmet tasted a set of n dishes on the first day and a set of m dishes on the second day. He made a table a of size n \u00d7 m, in which he described his impressions.

To find the possible problems it was decided to carry out a series of tests. At the beginning of each test the robot prototype will be placed in cell (x_0, y_0) of a rectangular squared field of size x \u00d7 y, after that a mine will be installed into one of the squares of the field. It is supposed to conduct exactly x\u00b7y tests, each time a mine is installed into a square that has never been used before. The starting cell of the robot always remains the same.\n\nAfter placing the objects on the field the robot will have to run a sequence of commands given by string s, consisting only of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'. These commands tell the robot to move one square to the left, to the right, up or down, or stay idle if moving in the given direction is impossible. As soon as the robot fulfills all the sequence of commands, it will blow up due to a bug in the code. But if at some moment of time the robot is at the same square with the mine, it will also blow up, but not due to a bug in the code.\n\nMoving to the left decreases coordinate y, and moving to the right increases it. Similarly, moving up decreases the x coordinate, and moving down increases it.\n\nThe tests can go on for very long, so your task is to predict their results.

Actually, this problem is a subtask of the problem D2 from the same contest and the solution of D2 solves this subtask too.\n\nA team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.\n\nLet's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers $f(a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 \\dots b_{q - 1} b_q)$, where $a_1 \\dots a_p$ and $b_1 \\dots b_q$ are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.\n\nIn other words, the function $f(x, y)$ alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers $x$ and $y$ by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number $y$. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.\n\nFor example: $$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212$$ $$f(7777, 888) = 7787878$$ $$f(33, 44444) = 4443434$$ $$f(555, 6) = 5556$$ $$f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$\n\nFormally,  if $p \\ge q$ then $f(a_1 \\dots a_p, b_1 \\dots b_q) = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$;  if $p < q$ then $f(a_1 \\dots a_p, b_1 \\dots b_q) = b_1 b_2 \\dots b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 \\dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$. \n\nMishanya gives you an array consisting of $n$ integers $a_i$. All numbers in this array are of equal length (that is, they consist of the same number of digits).

In a few moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the road.\n\nWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x_1, y_1), and the distress signal came from the point (x_2, y_2).\n\nDue to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed $v_{\\operatorname{max}}$ meters per second.\n\nOf course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (v_{x}, v_{y}) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (w_{x}, w_{y}). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (u_{x}, u_{y}) is blowing, then after $T$ seconds the new position of the dirigible will be $(x + \\tau \\cdot u_{x}, y + \\tau \\cdot u_{y})$.\n\nGadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally. He coped with the task easily, but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value, aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget.

The architecture was the paralellepiped of size n \u00d7 m \u00d7 k, split into 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to n, the line number from 1 to m and the column number from 1 to k.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (x, y, z) can send messages to CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) cannot send messages to CPU (x, y, z).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages.

{"problem_id": "test_1702", "description": "Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts for two hours and contains five problems.\n\nFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.\n\nSolvers fraction ranges and corresponding maximum point values:\n- (1/2, 1]: 500\n- (1/4, 1/2]: 1000\n- (1/8, 1/4]: 1500\n- (1/16, 1/8]: 2000\n- (1/32, 1/16]: 2500\n- [0, 1/32]: 3000\n\nPay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1/4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.\n\nIf the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x/250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000\u00b7(1 - 40/250) = 1680 points for this problem.\n\nThere are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem.\n\nWith two seconds until the end of the round, all participants' submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every submission will pass the system testing.\n\nUnfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 10^9 + 7 new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasn't solved.\n\nVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds.

Once every year, it was customary for the king to give audience to the rich merchants of his country in a large hall.

He would announce his name and his wealth. However, our quirky king demanded that in addition, he should also announce the rank of the merchant among all those in the hall (at the time of his arrival) in terms of his wealth.\nFor example, let us suppose that the wealth of the 6 merchants who met the king (in the order in which they arrived) is given by the sequence\n78 24 68 40 39 89\nThen, clearly the first merchant is the richest in the hall when he enters it (since there are no others in the hall) and so his rank is 1. Since 24 < 78 the rank of the second merchant when he enters the hall is 2. The rank of the third merchant is also 2 since 24 < 68 < 78. The rank of the fourth merchant is 3 since 24 < 40 < 68 < 78, the rank of the fifth merchant is 4 since 24 < 39 < 40 < 68 < 78 and finally the rank of the sixth merchant is 1 since 24 < 39 < 40 < 68 < 78 < 89.

{"problem_id": "test_1545", "description": "Mahmoud wrote a message s of length n. He wants to send it as a birthday present to his friend Moaz who likes strings. He wrote it on a magical paper but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't allow character number i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a string of length more than a_{i}. For example, if a_1 = 2 he can't write character 'a' on this paper in a string of length 3 or more. String \"aa\" is allowed while string \"aaa\" is not.\n\nMahmoud decided to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that he can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if a_1 = 2 and he wants to send string \"aaa\", he can split it into \"a\" and \"aa\" and use 2 magical papers, or into \"a\", \"a\" and \"a\" and use 3 magical papers. He can't split it into \"aa\" and \"aa\" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. He can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions.\n\nA substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings \"ab\", \"abc\" and \"b\" are substrings of string \"abc\", while strings \"acb\" and \"ac\" are not. Any string is a substring of itself.\n\nWhile Mahmoud was thinking of how to split the message, Ehab told him that there are many ways to split it. After that Mahmoud asked you three questions: How many ways are there to split the string into substrings such that every substring fulfills the condition of the magical paper, the sum of their lengths is n and they don't overlap? Compute the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. What is the maximum length of a substring that can appear in some valid splitting? What is the minimum number of substrings the message can be spit in?\n\nTwo ways are considered different, if the sets of split positions differ.

He has an app on this smartphone which contains n Japanese crosswords to solve. Adilbek has decided to solve them all one by one in the order they are listed in the app, without skipping any crossword. For each crossword, a number t_i is given that represents the time it takes an average crossword expert to solve this crossword (the time is given in seconds).\n\nAdilbek is a true crossword expert, but, unfortunately, he is sometimes unlucky in choosing the way to solve the crossword. So, it takes him either t_i seconds or t_i + 1 seconds to solve the i-th crossword, equiprobably (with probability 1/2 he solves the crossword in exactly t_i seconds, and with probability 1/2 he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.\n\nAfter T seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than T seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all).

You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nFirst, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:\n\nYuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.\n\nYuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, {2,3,1,5,4} is a permutation, but {1,2,2} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and {1,3,4} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).\n\nAfter that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:\n\nIf Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing. The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels.\n\nYuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?\n\nThis problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:\n\nLet's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.\n\nYou are given n, a and a prime number p \u2264 n.

{"problem_id": "train_3633", "description": "OK, my warriors! Now that you beat the big BOSS, you can unlock three new skills. (Does it sound like we're playing an RPG? ;-)\n\n## The Arrow Function (JS only)\n\nThe first skill is the arrow function. Let's look at some examples to see how it works:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nAs you can see, its syntax is:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf only one parameter exists on the left side of the arrow, the bracket can be omitted. If only one expression exists on the right side of the arrow, the curly braces can also be omitted. The example below shows a function with the () and {} omitted.\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nIf the right side of the arrow is a complex statement, you must use curly braces:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nSo far, our examples have used function assignment. However, an arrow function can also be used as a parameter to a function call, as well. When used as a parameter, the arrow function does not require a name. Let's rewrite the string.replace() example we saw from a previous training using our new skill:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nString.replace takes a regular expression and a function. The function is invoked on each substring matching the regex, and return the string replacement of that match. In this case, the arrow function takes the matched string as the parameter ```x```, and returns the upper cased value of ```x```.\n\nIn the soon to learn the arrayObject and its methods, there are many applications on the arrow function, which is the reason we first learn the arrow function. The arrow function has more complex usage and usage restrictions, but we don't need to learn to be so deep, so we only learn the contents of the above.\n\n## The Spread Operator\n\nThe second skill is the ```spread operator```. The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.\n\nIt looks like this: ...obj. It can be used in three places:\n\n1\\. In function calls:\n\n```python\ndef plus(a,b,c,d,e): return a+b+c+d+e\n\narg1=[1,2,3,4,5]\narg2=[2,3]\nprint plus(...arg1) #output is 15\nprint plus(...arg2) #output is 5\n```\n```...arg1``` spreads all the elements in arg1 into individual parameters to plus(). \nIn Javascript, it's also possible to use the spread operator in the middle of a parameter list, as was done with ```...arg2```.\n\n2\\. Creating array literals (JS and Ruby):\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS and Ruby\n```\n```...a``` spreads out the array's elements, making them individual elements in b.\n\n3\\. Used for ```deconstruction```. destructuring is also a new member of ES6. It is the third skill we learn in this training.\n\nFirst, let's look at a simple example of destructuring:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\nprint a #output is 1\nprint b #output is 2\n```\nDestructuring allows us to assign variables in a sentence-like form. Here's a slightly more complicated example:\n```python\na,b=[1,2] #or [a,b]=[1,2]\n#old way to swap them:\n#c=a; a=b; c=b\nb,a=[a,b] #or [b,a]=[a,b]\nprint a #output is 2\nprint b #output is 1\n```\nWith destructuring, we don't need a temporary variable to help us exchange the two values.\n\nYou can use the spread operator for destructuring like this:\n\n```python\n#ignore this part, it is just for JS\n```\nPlease note: the spread operator must  be the last variable: ```[...a,b]=[1,2,3,4,5]``` does not work.\n\n```a``` was assigned to the first element of the array, and``` b ```was initialized with the remaining elements in the array.\n\nJavascript note: If you see an ellipse ... in the argument list in a function declaration, it is not a spread operator, it is a structure called rest parameters. The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, like this:\n\n```python\ndef plus(*num):\n  rs=0\n  for x in num: rs+=x\n  return rs\nprint plus(1,2) #output is 3\nprint plus(3,4,5) #output is 12\n```\nThe rest paramater must be the last argument in the function definition argument list.\n\nIn the next example, we use a rest parameter to collect all the values passed to mul() after the first into an array. We then multiply each of them by the first parameter and return that array:\n```python\ndef mul(a,*b):\n  b=list(b) #default type would be tuple\n  for i in xrange(len(b)): b[i]*=a\n  return b\nprint mul(2,1,1,1) #output is [2,2,2]\nprint mul(2,1,2,3,4) #output is [2,4,6,8]\n```\n\nOk, the lesson is over. Did you get it all? Let's do a task, now.\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function ```shuffleIt```. The function accepts two or more parameters. The first parameter arr is an array of numbers, followed by an arbitrary number of numeric arrays. Each numeric array contains two numbers, which are indices for elements in arr (the numbers will always be within bounds). For every such array, swap the elements. Try to use all your new skills: arrow functions, the spread operator, destructuring, and rest parameters.\n\nExample:\n```\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2]) should return [1,3,2,4,5]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4]) should return [1,3,2,5,4]\nshuffleIt([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]) should return [1,3,5,2,4]\n```", "test_cases": [{"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "shuffle_it([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3])", "correct_output": "[1, 3, 5, 2, 4]", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "shuffle_it", "correct_solution": "def shuffle_it(A,*T):\n    for x,y in T:\n        A[x],A[y]=A[y],A[x]\n    return A", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

The operation of the module is complicated by the fact that stop numbers occur in the request not in the order they were visited but in the non-decreasing order.\n\nFor example, if the number of stops is 6, and the part of the bus path starts at the bus stop number 5, ends at the stop number 3 and passes the stops as follows: $5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 3$, then the request about this segment of the path will have form: 3, 4, 5, 5, 6. If the bus on the segment of the path from stop 5 to stop 3 has time to drive past the 1-th stop (i.e., if we consider a segment that ends with the second visit to stop 3 on the way from 5), then the request will have form: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6.\n\nYou will have to repeat the Berland programmers achievement and implement this function.", "test_cases": [{"input": "calculate_bus_distance(6, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13], 5, [3, 4, 5, 5, 6])", "correct_output": "10", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "calculate_bus_distance(6, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13], 9, [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6])", "correct_output": "16", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "calculate_bus_distance(3, [10, 200, 300], 4, [1, 2, 2, 3])", "correct_output": "-1", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}, {"input": "calculate_bus_distance(3, [1, 2, 3], 4, [1, 2, 2, 3])", "correct_output": "3", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "calculate_bus_distance", "correct_solution": "def calculate_bus_distance(n, a, m, b):\n    c = [0] * n\n    b = [x - 1 for x in b]\n    for e in b:\n        c[e] += 1\n    c[0] *= 2\n    c[-1] *= 2\n    d = 0\n    df = 0\n    r = max([e // 2 for e in c])\n    c = [e - r * 2 for e in c]\n    if not any(c):\n        de = a[1] - a[0]\n        for i in range(1, n - 1):\n            if a[i + 1] - a[i] != de:\n                return -1\n        return r * de * 2 * (n - 1) - de\n    else:\n        for i in range(n - 1):\n            de = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n            d += min(c[i], c[i + 1]) * de\n            df += de\n        return d + r * 2 * df", "difficulty": "interview", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

A lot of boys were dreaming of becoming a knight, while a lot of girls were dreaming of marrying a knight on a white horse.\n\nIn this problem we consider one of these tournaments.\n\nLet's us call a tournament binary, if it runs according to the scheme described below:\n\n- Exactly N knights take part in the tournament, N=2K for some integer K > 0.\n\n- Each knight has a unique skill called strength, described as an integer from the interval [1, N].\n\n- Initially, all the knights are standing in a line, waiting for a battle. Since all their strengths are unique, each initial configuration can be described as a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.\n\n- There are exactly K rounds in the tournament, 2K - i + 1 knights take part in the i'th round. The K'th round is called the final.\n\n- The i'th round runs in the following way: for each positive integer j \u2264 2K - i happens a battle between a knight on the 2\u2219j'th position and a knight on the 2\u2219j+1'th position. The strongest of two continues his tournament, taking the j'th position on the next round, while the weakest of two is forced to leave.\n\n- The only knight, who has won K rounds, is the winner. The only knight, who has won K - 1 rounds, but lost the final, is the runner-up.\n\nAs you can see from the scheme, the winner is always the same, an initial configuration doesn't change anything. So, your task is to determine chances of each knight to appear in the final.\n\nFormally, for each knight you need to count the number of initial configurations, which will lead him to the final.

{"problem_id": "train_1680", "description": "The Antique Comedians of India prefer comedies to tragedies. Unfortunately, most of the ancient plays are tragedies. Therefore the dramatic advisor of ACI has decided to transfigure some tragedies into comedies. Obviously, this work is very hard because the basic sense of the play must be kept intact, although all the things change to their opposites. For example the numbers: if any number appears in the tragedy, it must be converted to its reversed form before being accepted into the comedy play. A reversed number is a number written in Arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the tragedy, he has 5421 of them now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also, note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros. ACI needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 23 could be 32, 320, or 3200 before reversing).

{"problem_id": "train_918", "description": "Mr. Wire Less is not that good at implementing circuit in a breadboard. In his Digital Logic Design course, he has to implement several boolean functions using the breadboard. In a breadboard, inputs are given through the switches and outputs are taken through the LEDs. Each input switch can be either in ground state or in high state. So, if he wishes to implement a boolean function, f(x1, x2, .., xn) that takes n boolean values as input and returns m boolean values as output, he will use n switches and m LEDs. \nMr. Wire Less can quickly assemble the necessary ICs and wires, but the key problem is testing. While testing he has to check with all possible input combination, to make sure whether the output of LED corresponds to the expected output or not. This is taking too long for him, as most of the switches are jammed and difficult to toggle. \nMr. Wire Less is asking for help to minimize his time of testing. So, your task is to minimize the total number of switch-toggle throughout the testing.\nFor example, if Mr. Wire Less has to test a function f(x0, x1) of two variables, he may choose this switching-sequence for testing 00, 11, 10, 01. In this case, the total number of switch-toggle will be 2+1+2 = 5. But if he tests in this sequence 00, 10, 11, 01 total number of toggle will be 1+1+1 = 3.\nGiven n, you have to output the minimum number of toggle needed for complete testing.

In this game you control a large army, and your goal is to conquer n castles of your opponent.\n\nInitially you control an army of k warriors.

After you take control over a castle, you recruit new warriors into your army \u2014 formally, after you capture the i-th castle, b_i warriors join your army. Furthermore, after capturing a castle (or later) you can defend it: if you leave at least one warrior in a castle, this castle is considered defended. Each castle has an importance parameter c_i, and your total score is the sum of importance values over all defended castles. There are two ways to defend a castle:\n\n- if you are currently in the castle i, you may leave one warrior to defend castle i;\n- there are m one-way portals connecting the castles. Each portal is characterised by two numbers of castles u and v (for each portal holds u > v). A portal can be used as follows: if you are currently in the castle u, you may send one warrior to defend castle v.\n\nObviously, when you order your warrior to defend some castle, he leaves your army.\n\nYou capture the castles in fixed order: you have to capture the first one, then the second one, and so on. After you capture the castle i (but only before capturing castle i + 1) you may recruit new warriors from castle i, leave a warrior to defend castle i, and use any number of portals leading from castle i to other castles having smaller numbers. As soon as you capture the next castle, these actions for castle i won't be available to you.\n\nIf, during some moment in the game, you don't have enough warriors to capture the next castle, you lose.

Specifically, during step t_{i} (steps are numbered from 1) Xenia watches spies numbers l_{i}, l_{i} + 1, l_{i} + 2, ..., r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n). Of course, if during some step a spy is watched, he can't do anything: neither give the note nor take it from some other spy. Otherwise, Xenia reveals the spies' cunning plot. Nevertheless, if the spy at the current step keeps the note, Xenia sees nothing suspicious even if she watches him.\n\nYou've got s and f. Also, you have the steps during which Xenia watches spies and which spies she is going to watch during each step. Find the best way the spies should act in order to pass the note from spy s to spy f as quickly as possible (in the minimum number of steps).", "test_cases": [{"input": "spy_note_passing(3, 5, 1, 3, [(1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (4, 1, 1), (10, 1, 3)])", "correct_output": "XXRR", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "spy_note_passing", "correct_solution": "def spy_note_passing(n, m, s, f, watch_schedule):\n    L = []\n    R = []\n    T = []\n    for t, l, r in watch_schedule:\n        T.append(t)\n        L.append(l)\n        R.append(r)\n    \n    if(f>s):\n        i=s\n        step=1\n        ind=0\n        Ans=\"\"\n        while(i!=f):\n            if(ind>=m or T[ind]!=step):\n                Ans+=\"R\"\n                i+=1\n            else:\n                if((i>=L[ind] and i<=R[ind]) or (i+1>=L[ind] and i+1<=R[ind])):\n                    Ans+=\"X\"\n                else:\n                    Ans+=\"R\"\n                    i+=1\n                ind+=1\n            step+=1\n    else:\n        i=s\n        step=1\n        ind=0\n        Ans=\"\"\n        while(i!=f):\n            if(ind>=m or T[ind]!=step):\n                Ans+=\"L\"\n                i-=1\n            else:\n                if((i>=L[ind] and i<=R[ind]) or (i-1>=L[ind] and i-1<=R[ind])):\n                    Ans+=\"X\"\n                else:\n                    Ans+=\"L\"\n                    i-=1\n                ind+=1\n            step+=1\n    return Ans", "difficulty": "interview", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

{"problem_id": "train_1420", "description": "In an array, a block is a maximal sequence of identical elements. Since blocks are maximal, adjacent blocks have distinct elements, so the array breaks up into a series of blocks. For example, given the array [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 4, 4], there are 6 blocks: [3, 3], [2, 2, 2], [1], [5], [8], [4, 4].\n\nIn this task, you are given two arrays, A (of length n), and B (of length m), and a number K. You have to interleave A and B to form an array C such that C has K blocks. Each way of interleaving A and B can be represented as a 0-1 array X of length n+m in which X[j] is 0 if C[j] came from A and X[j] is 1 if C[j] came from B.\n\nYour task is to find the number of different interleavings X of A and B that produce an output array C with exactly K blocks.

Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are \"lights on\" and \"lights off\"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.\n\nThe lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M.

The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.\n\nSince you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can insert at most one element into the program a, so it still should be a good program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the begining or at the end of a.\n\nFind such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible.

This is done by calculating a single-digit value based on the product number, and then appending that digit to the product number to arrive at the product code.\n\nWhen the product code is checked, the check digit value is stripped off and recalculated. If the supplied value does not match the recalculated value, the product code is rejected.\n\nA simple scheme for generating self-check digits, described here, is called Modulus 11 Self-Check.\n\n## Calculation method\n\nEach digit in the product number is assigned a multiplication factor. The factors are assigned ***from right to left***, starting at `2` and counting up. For numbers longer than six digits, the factors restart at `2` after `7` is reached. The product of each digit and its factor is calculated, and the products summed. For example:\n\n```python\ndigit     :  1    6    7    7    0    3    6    2    5\nfactor    :  4    3    2    7    6    5    4    3    2\n           ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---\n             4 + 18 + 14 + 49 +  0 + 15 + 24 +  6 + 10 = 140\n```\n\nThen the sum of the products is divided by the prime number `11`. The remainder is inspected, and:\n\n* if the remainder is `0`, the check digit is also `0`\n* if the remainder is `1`, the check digit is replaced by an uppercase `X`\n* for all others, the remainder is subtracted from `11`\n\nThe result is the **check digit**.\n\n## Your task\n\nYour task is to implement this algorithm and return the input number with the correct check digit appended.", "test_cases": [{"input": "add_check_digit('036532')", "correct_output": "'0365327'", "broken_output": null, "use_broken": false}], "dataset": "apps", "function_name": "add_check_digit", "correct_solution": "from itertools import cycle\n\ndef add_check_digit(number):\n    fact = cycle([2,3,4,5,6,7])\n    r = sum( int(c) * next(fact) for c in number[::-1]) % 11\n    return number + ('0' if not r else 'X' if r == 1 else str(11-r))", "difficulty": "introductory", "tags": [], "prompt": null, "full_completion": null, "parsed_completion": null, "mixed_test_cases": []}

There is at most one bus running between a pair of stops.\n\nPolycarp made n trips on buses. About each trip the stop where he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The trips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes.\n\nIt is known that one trip on any bus costs a burles. In case when passenger makes a transshipment the cost of trip decreases to b burles (b < a). A passenger makes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with the stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be made with transshipment.\n\nFor example, if Polycarp made three consecutive trips: \"BerBank\" $\\rightarrow$ \"University\", \"University\" $\\rightarrow$ \"BerMall\", \"University\" $\\rightarrow$ \"BerBank\", then he payed a + b + a = 2a + b burles. From the BerBank he arrived to the University, where he made transshipment to the other bus and departed to the BerMall. Then he walked to the University and returned to the BerBank by bus.\n\nAlso Polycarp can buy no more than k travel cards. Each travel card costs f burles. The travel card for a single bus route makes free of charge any trip by this route (in both directions).

Xenia is currently studying bit operations. To better understand how they work, Xenia decided to calculate some value v for a.\n\nNamely, it takes several iterations to calculate value v. At the first iteration, Xenia writes a new sequence a_1 or a_2, a_3 or a_4, ..., a_2^{n} - 1 or a_2^{n}, consisting of 2^{n} - 1 elements. In other words, she writes down the bit-wise OR of adjacent elements of sequence a. At the second iteration, Xenia writes the bitwise exclusive OR of adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the first iteration. At the third iteration Xenia writes the bitwise OR of the adjacent elements of the sequence obtained after the second iteration. And so on; the operations of bitwise exclusive OR and bitwise OR alternate. In the end, she obtains a sequence consisting of one element, and that element is v.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose that sequence a = (1, 2, 3, 4). Then let's write down all the transformations (1, 2, 3, 4)  \u2192  (1 or 2 = 3, 3 or 4 = 7)  \u2192  (3 xor 7 = 4). The result is v = 4.\n\nYou are given Xenia's initial sequence. But to calculate value v for a given sequence would be too easy, so you are given additional m queries.
