You should efficiently calculate every coefficient one by one and stop when a coefficient is not divisible by p to avoid pointless calculations. The easiest way to calculate coefficients is to take advantage of binomial coefficients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient and pascal triangle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle . \n\nYou should also take advantage of the symmetry of binomial coefficients. You can look at these kata: http://www.codewars.com/kata/pascals-triangle and http://www.codewars.com/kata/pascals-triangle-number-2\n\nThe kata here only use the simple theorem. The general AKS test is way more complex.  The simple approach is a good exercie but impractical. The general AKS test will be the subject of another kata as it is one of the best performing primality test algorithms.\n\nThe main problem of this algorithm is the big numbers emerging from binomial coefficients in the polynomial expansion. As usual Javascript reach its limit on big integer very fast. (This simple algorithm is far less performing than a trivial algorithm here).

These are the representatives of the modern world, in which the ratio of lack of time is so great that they do not even watch foreign top-rated TV series. Such people often create problems in queues, because the newcomer does not see the last person in the queue and takes a place after the \"virtual\" link in this chain, wondering where this legendary figure has left.\n\nThe Smart Beaver has been ill and he's made an appointment with a therapist. The doctor told the Beaver the sad news in a nutshell: it is necessary to do an electrocardiogram. The next day the Smart Beaver got up early, put on the famous TV series on download (three hours till the download's complete), clenched his teeth and bravely went to join a queue to the electrocardiogram room, which is notorious for the biggest queues at the clinic.\n\nHaving stood for about three hours in the queue, the Smart Beaver realized that many beavers had not seen who was supposed to stand in the queue before them and there was a huge mess. He came up to each beaver in the ECG room queue and asked who should be in front of him in the queue. If the beaver did not know his correct position in the queue, then it might be his turn to go get an ECG, or maybe he should wait for a long, long time...\n\nAs you've guessed, the Smart Beaver was in a hurry home, so he gave you all the necessary information for you to help him to determine what his number in the queue can be.\n\nWrite a function named `find_possible_queue_positions` to solve this problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Your task is to transform an input nested list into an hypercube list, which is a special kind of nested list where each level must have the very same size. A nested list is a list that may contain either non-list items or more nested lists as items in the list. A basic element refers to any non-list element of a nested list. A nested list's dimension is defined as the deepest the list goes. A nested list's size is defined as the longest the list or any of its sublists go. A 1-dimensional hypercube list of size n is a nested list of dimension 1 and size n. A d-dimensional hypercube list of size n is a nested list of dimension d and size n such that the nested list has n elements each of which is a d-1-dimensional hypercube list of size n. Your task is to implement normalize which converts any given nested_list to be in hypercube format with the same dimension and size as the given nested list, extending and growing with the given growing_value. The default growing value is the integer 0. The algorithm should behave as follows: If a hypercube list of dimension 1 needs extra elements, append the required number of growing value elements. If a hypercube list of dimension greater than 1 has a direct basic element as a child, replace it with the required hypercube list with its basic elements all being the replaced item. If a hypercube list of dimension greater than 1 needs extra elements, append the required hypercube list with its basic elements all being the growing value.

Everybody was now assigned to battle and they will fight until one of the races completely dissapears: the Deadly War has begun!\n\nEvery single lemming has a power measure that describes its ability to fight. When two single lemmings fight with each one, the lemming with more power survives and the other one dies. However, the power of the living lemming gets smaller after the fight, exactly in the value of the power of the lemming that died. For example, if we have a green lemming with power 50 and a blue lemming with power 40, the blue one dies and the green one survives, but having only power 10 after the battle (50-40=10). If two lemmings have the same power when they fight, both of them die.\n\nIn the fight between the two races, there are a certain number of battlefields. Each race assigns one lemming for each battlefield, starting with the most powerful. So for example, if a race has 5 lemmings with power {50, 50, 40, 40, 30} and we have 3 battlefields, then a lemming with power 50 will be assigned to battlefield 1, another with 50 power will be assigned to battlefield 2 and last a lemming with power 40 will go to battlefield 3. The other race will do the same.\n\nThe Deadly War is processed by having each race send its best soldiers as described to the battlefields, making a battle round. Then, all battles process at the same time, and some of the lemmings will emerge victorious (but with less power) and some of them will die. The surviving ones will return to their race's army and then a new round will begin, with each race sending again its best remaining soldiers to the battlefields. If at some point a race does not have enough soldiers to fill all battlefields, then only the ones with soldiers from both races will have a fight.\n\nThe Deadly War ends when one of the races has no more lemmings or when both of them disappear at the same time. For example, imagine a war with 2 battlefields and a green army with powers {20,10} and a blue army with powers {10, 10, 15}. The first round will have 20 vs 15 in battlefield 1 and 10 vs 10 in battlefield 2. After these battles, green race will still have a power 5 lemming (that won on battlefield 1) and blue race will have one with power 10 (that did not fight). The ones in battlefield 2 died, since they both had the same power. Afer that comes a second round, and only battlefield 1 will have a fight, being 5 vs 10.

As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules: Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below. During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2. Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p. All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p.\n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere.\n\nWrite a function named `check_permutation_game` to solve this problem.

Convert the permutations `q` and `s` to 0-based for easier indexing.\n2. Decompose `q` into disjoint cycles.  For each cycle of length `L`, we check that the target permutation `s` moves each element in that cycle by the same shift `r_mod` (mod `L`).  If not, it\u2019s impossible.\n3. From each cycle we get a congruence `r \u2261 r_mod (mod L)`.  We merge these congruences by a standard CRT routine (`crt_pair`), maintaining a running solution `r \u2261 a0 (mod m0)`.\n4. Finally we check whether there is some integer `r` in the arithmetic progression `a0 + m0\u22c5t` that lies between `\u2212k` and `k` and satisfies `(r + k) % 2 = 0`.  This is done by computing the range of `t` and, if necessary, imposing a parity constraint on `t`.\n\nIf all these conditions can be met, we return `\"YES\"`, otherwise `\"NO\"`."}]}

The cost for the dish is $c_i$. Meanwhile, $r_i$ will be reduced by $1$. Otherwise, the customer will be served $1$ dish of the cheapest available kind of food if there are any. If there are multiple cheapest kinds of food, the one with the smallest index among the cheapest will be served. The cost will be the cost for the dish served and the remain for the corresponding dish will be reduced by $1$. If there are no more dishes at all, the customer will leave angrily.

That is, we delete the first element $b_1$ of $b$, merge the remaining arrays, then add $b_1$ to the beginning of the result. \n\nThis algorithm has the nice property that if $a$ and $b$ are sorted, then $\\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$ will also be sorted. For example, it is used as a subroutine in merge-sort. For this problem, however, we will consider the same procedure acting on non-sorted arrays as well. For example, if $a=[3,1]$ and $b=[2,4]$, then $\\mathrm{merge}(a,b)=[2,3,1,4]$.\n\nA permutation is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nThere is a permutation $p$ of length $2n$. Determine if there exist two arrays $a$ and $b$, each of length $n$ and with no elements in common, so that $p=\\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$.\n\nWrite a function named `can_split_permutation` to solve this problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Denis was very sad after Nastya rejected him. So he decided to walk through the gateways to have some fun. And luck smiled at him! When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something.\n\nDenis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of $n$ steps. At the $i$-th step, a place is chosen for the number $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$. The position for the number $i$ is defined as follows:\n\n  For all $j$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $r_j$  \u2014 the minimum index such that $j \\leq r_j \\leq n$, and the position $r_j$ is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of $r_j$ is not defined.  For all $t$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $count_t$  \u2014 the number of positions $1 \\leq j \\leq n$ such that $r_j$ is defined and $r_j = t$.  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the $count$ array is maximum.  The generator selects one of these positions for the number $i$. The generator can choose any position.\n\nLet's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:\n\n [Image]\n\nLet $n = 5$ and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers $1, 2, 3$ in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number $4$:\n\n  The values of $r$ will be $r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times]$, where $\\times$ means an indefinite value.  Then the $count$ values will be $count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$.  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: $3$ and $4$. The value in the $count$ array for position $3$ is $3$, for position $4$ it is $1$.  The maximum value is reached only for position $3$, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number $4$.\n\nSatisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.\n\nUnfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector describes which element it matches.\n\nSometimes element is matched to multiple selectors. In this case, element inherits multiple styles, from each rule it matches. Rules can override each other. To solve this problem, each selector has it's own 'specificity' - e.g. weight. The selector with greater specificity overrides the other selector.\n\nYour task is to calculate the weights of two selectors and determine which of them will beat the other one.\n\nFor simplicity, all selectors in test cases are CSS1-compatible, test cases don't include pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, attribute selectors, etc. Below is an explanation on how to weight two selectors.\n\nThe simplest selector type is tagname selector. It writes as a simple alphanumeric identifier: eg body, div, h1, etc. It has the least weight. If selectors have multiple elements - the selector with more elements win. For example, body p beats div, because it refers to 2 (nested) elements rather than 1.\n\nAnother simple selector is .class selector. It begins with dot and refer to element with specific class attribute. Class selectors can also be applied to tagname selectors, so div.red refer to element. They can be grouped, for example, .red.striped. Class selector beats tagname selector.\n\nThe most weighted selector type in stylesheet is #id selector. It begins with hash sign and refer to element with specific id attribute. It can also be standalone, or applied to an element. Id selector beats both selector types.\n\nAnd the least weighted selector is *, which has no specificity and can be beat by any other selector.\n\nSelectors can be combined, for example, body #menu ul li.active refers to li element with class=\"active\", placed inside ul element, placed inside element width id=\"menu\", placed inside body.\n\nSpecificity calculation is simple.\n\nSelector with more #id selectors wins\nIf both are same, the winner is selector with more .class selectors\nIf both are same, selector with more elements wins\nIf all of above values are same, the winner is selector that appear last Name the function `compare_css_selectors`.\n\nIt must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert compare_css_selectors('.big', '.small') == '.small'\nassert compare_css_selectors('.class', '#id') == '#id'\nassert compare_css_selectors('div.big', '.small') == 'div.big'\nassert compare_css_selectors('body p', 'div') == 'body p'\n\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.

You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nKoa the Koala is at the beach!\n\nThe beach consists (from left to right) of a shore, $n+1$ meters of sea and an island at $n+1$ meters from the shore.\n\nShe measured the depth of the sea at $1, 2, \\dots, n$ meters from the shore and saved them in array $d$. $d_i$ denotes the depth of the sea at $i$ meters from the shore for $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n\nLike any beach this one has tide, the intensity of the tide is measured by parameter $k$ and affects all depths from the beginning at time $t=0$ in the following way:\n\n  For a total of $k$ seconds, each second, tide increases all depths by $1$.\n\n  Then, for a total of $k$ seconds, each second, tide decreases all depths by $1$.\n\n  This process repeats again and again (ie. depths increase for $k$ seconds then decrease for $k$ seconds and so on ...).\n\nFormally, let's define $0$-indexed array $p = [0, 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 2, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, \\ldots, 2, 1]$ of length $2k$. At time $t$ ($0 \\le t$) depth at $i$ meters from the shore equals $d_i + p[t \\bmod 2k]$ ($t \\bmod 2k$ denotes the remainder of the division of $t$ by $2k$). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding.\n\nAt time $t=0$ Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island. Suppose that at some time $t$ ($0 \\le t$) she is at $x$ ($0 \\le x \\le n$) meters from the shore:\n\n  In one second Koa can swim $1$ meter further from the shore ($x$ changes to $x+1$) or not swim at all ($x$ stays the same), in both cases $t$ changes to $t+1$.\n\n  As Koa is a bad swimmer, the depth of the sea at the point where she is can't exceed $l$ at integer points of time (or she will drown). More formally, if Koa is at $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le n$) meters from the shore at the moment $t$ (for some integer $t\\ge 0$), the depth of the sea at this point  \u2014 $d_x + p[t \\bmod 2k]$  \u2014 can't exceed $l$. In other words, $d_x + p[t \\bmod 2k] \\le l$ must hold always.\n\n  Once Koa reaches the island at $n+1$ meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.\n\nNote that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there).\n\nKoa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island.

After buying this good, the number of Vasya's coins will decrease by a_i, (i.e it becomes p := p - a_i). Vasya can buy a good with the index i, and also choose exactly k-1 goods, the price of which does not exceed a_i, if he currently has enough coins (i.e p >= a_i).

The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:   Only one disk can be moved at a time.  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \n\nWith three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^{n} - 1, where n is the number of disks. (c) Wikipedia.\n\nSmallY's puzzle is very similar to the famous Tower of Hanoi. In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle you need to solve a puzzle in minimum number of moves, in SmallY's puzzle each move costs some money and you need to solve the same puzzle but for minimal cost.

There are dozens of thousands of books in the library.\n\nSome long and uninteresting story was removed...\n\nThe alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2 < 3, 2' < 3', 3' < 2.\n\nA word x_1, x_2, ..., x_{a} is not lexicographically greater than y_1, y_2, ..., y_{b} if one of the two following conditions holds:   a \u2264 b and x_1 = y_1, ..., x_{a} = y_{a}, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word;  there is a position 1 \u2264 j \u2264 min(a, b), such that x_1 = y_1, ..., x_{j} - 1 = y_{j} - 1 and x_{j} < y_{j}, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.\n\nFor example, the word \"3' 7 5\" is before the word \"2 4' 6\" in lexicographical order.

He wants to change some letters to large (let's call this process a capitalization) in such a way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order. However, he soon realized that for some reason he can't change a single letter in a single word. He only can choose a letter and change all of its occurrences in all words to large letters. He can perform this operation any number of times with arbitrary letters of Bookland's alphabet.\n\nHelp Denis to choose which letters he needs to capitalize (make large) in order to make the sequence of words lexicographically ordered, or determine that it is impossible.\n\nNote that some words can be equal.\n\nWrite a function named `solve_lexicographic_ordering` to solve this problem.

To do this, you can remove any non-empty substring of the path. But this company doesn't want their customers to notice the change in the robot behavior. It means that if before the optimization the robot ended its path at the point (x_e, y_e), then after optimization (i.e. removing some single substring from s) the robot also ends its path at the point (x_e, y_e).\n\nThis optimization is a low-budget project so you need to remove the shortest possible non-empty substring to optimize the robot's path such that the endpoint of his path doesn't change.

He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.\nFor example, the W string can be formed from \"aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\" such as:\na\na             d\na     #     d\na   b c   d\na b   c d\n#     #\n\nHe also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.\nMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):\n- The string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1 < P2 < P3 (indexes are 0-origin).\n- Each substring of S[0, P1\u22121], S[P1+1, P2\u22121], S[P2+1, P3\u22121], S[P3+1, |S|\u22121] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details).\nNow, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the \"positions\" we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = '#' where P1 < i < P2 or P2 < i < P3.\nHelp Kira and he won't write your name in the Death Note.\nNote:\nFor a given string S, let S[k] denote the k+1th character of string S, and let the index of the character S[k] be k. Let |S| denote the length of the string S. And a substring of a string S is a string S[a, b] = S[a] S[a+1] ... S[b], where 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b < |S|. And a subsequence of a string S is a string S[i0] S[i1] ... S[in\u22121], where 0 \u2264 i0 < i1 < ... < in\u22121 < |S|.\nFor example, let S be the string \"kira\", then S[0] = 'k', S[1] = 'i', S[3] = 'a', and |S| = 4. All of S[0, 2] = \"kir\", S[1, 1] = \"i\", and S[0, 3] = \"kira\" are substrings of S, but \"ik\", \"kr\", and \"arik\" are not. All of \"k\", \"kr\", \"kira\", \"kia\" are subsequences of S, but \"ik\", \"kk\" are not.\nFrom the above definition of W string, for example, \"a#b#c#d\", \"aaa#yyy#aaa#yy\", and \"o#oo#ooo#oooo\" are W string, but \"a#b#c#d#e\", \"#a#a#a\", and \"aa##a#a\" are not.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In an array, a block is a maximal sequence of identical elements. Since blocks are maximal, adjacent blocks have distinct elements, so the array breaks up into a series of blocks. For example, given the array [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 8, 4, 4], there are 6 blocks: [3, 3], [2, 2, 2], [1], [5], [8], [4, 4].\n\nIn this task, you are given two arrays, A (of length n), and B (of length m), and a number K. You have to interleave A and B to form an array C such that C has K blocks. Each way of interleaving A and B can be represented as a 0-1 array X of length n+m in which X[j] is 0 if C[j] came from A and X[j] is 1 if C[j] came from B.\n\nYour task is to find the number of different interleavings X of A and B that produce an output array C with exactly K blocks. Note that we are counting the number of interleavings, not the number of different output arrays after interleaving.\n\nSince the answer might be large, return the answer modulo 10^8 + 7.\n\nThe interleaving process works as follows: Suppose A = A_1, A_2, ..., A_n and B = B_1, B_2, ..., B_m. The process uses an array X of size n + m, with exactly n 0's and m 1's. Using this array X, we create the output array C = C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n+m}, using the following algorithm:\ni = 0, j = 0\nwhile( (i+j)<(n+m) )\nif(X[i+j+1] == 0)\nC[i+j+1] = A[i+1]\ni = i+1\nelse\nC[i+j+1] = B[j+1]\nj = j+1\n\nThus if the X value is 0, we pick the next available element from A into C, and if it is 1, we pick from B instead.\n\nWrite a function named `count_valid_interleavings` to solve this problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In Arcady's garden there grows a peculiar apple-tree that fruits one time per year. Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number i (i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is p_{i}-th inflorescence and p_{i} < i.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to p_{a}-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.\n\nHelp Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\n\nWrite a function named `count_collected_apples` to solve this problem.
