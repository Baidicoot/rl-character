Fortunately, he still has a sequence of vertices, in which order vertices were visited by the BFS algorithm (the array a from the pseudocode). Monocarp knows that each vertex was visited exactly once (since they were put and taken from the queue exactly once). Also, he knows that all children of each vertex were viewed in ascending order.\n\nMonocarp knows that there are many trees (in the general case) with the same visiting order a, so he doesn't hope to restore his tree. Monocarp is okay with any tree that has minimum height.\n\nThe height of a tree is the maximum depth of the tree's vertices, and the depth of a vertex is the number of edges in the path from the root to it.
