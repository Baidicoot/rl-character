{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "General primality test are often computationally expensive, so in the biggest prime number race the idea is to study special sub-families of prime number and develop more effective tests for them.\n\n[Mersenne Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime) are prime numbers of the form: Mn = 2^(n) - 1. So far, 49 of them was found between M2 (3) and M74,207,281 which contains 22,338,618 digits and is (by September 2015) the biggest known prime. It has been found by GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search), wich use the test srudied here. (plus heuristics mentionned below)\n\nLucas and Lehmer have developed a [simple test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_primality_test) for Mersenne primes:\n\n> for `p` (an odd prime), the Mersenne number Mp is prime if and only if `S(p \u2212 1) = 0 mod Mp`,\n\n>where `S(n + 1) = S(n) * S(n) \u2212 2` and `S(1) = 4`\n\nThe goal of this kata is to implement this test. Given an integer `>=2`, the program should calculate the sequence `S(n)` up to `p-1` and calculate the remainder modulo `Mp`, then return `True` or `False` as a result of the test. The case `n = 2` should return `True`.\n\nYou should take advantage of the fact that:\n\n```k = (k mod 2^n + floor(k/2^n)) mod Mn```\n\nOr in other words, if we take the least significant `n` bits of `k`, and add the remaining bits of `k`, and then do this repeatedly until at most `n` bits remain, we can compute the remainder after dividing `k` by the Mersenne number `2^n\u22121` without using division.\n\nThis test can be improved using the fact that if `n` is not prime, `2^n-1` will not be prime. So in theory you can test for the primality of `n` beforehand. But in practice the test for the primality of `n` will rapidly outgrow in difficulty the Lucas-Lehmer test. So we can only use heuristics to rule out `n` with small factors but not complete factorization algorithm. You don't need to implement such heuristics here.\n\nThe rapid growth of `s^2` makes javascript reach its integer limit quickly (coherent result for `n = 13`, but not `17`).

Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into n pieces enumerated from 1 to n. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the i-th piece has color c_i where c_i = 0 defines black color, c_i = 1 defines white color and c_i = -1 means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color (0 or 1) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, [1 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0], [0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 1], [1], [0] are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece x to piece y if and only if there is an arrow from x to y.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity p where p = 0 stands for \"even\" and p = 1 stands for \"odd\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of p.\n\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro.

We build sparse tables `st_min`/`st_max` to answer range-min and range-max queries on `cur` in O(1).\n3. For each candidate user `L`, we extract their login/logout event positions. If there are none, `L` can always be the leader (just assume they were online throughout).\n4. Otherwise we determine the user\u2019s initial online status `s0` (inferred from their first event) and partition the intervals between events into segments where `L` is online or offline.\n5. Whenever `L` is offline, the total number of users online (`C0 + cur[t]`) must be zero and thus `cur[t]` must be constant across all those segments. We record that constant as `Kval`.\n6. We verify `Kval \u2264 0` (so initial count `C0 = -Kval \u2265 0`). Then in the segments where `L` is online, we require `C0 + cur[t] \u2265 1`, i.e. `cur[t] \u2265 Kval+1`.\n7. All checks use the sparse tables in O(1) per segment. If they pass, we add `L` to the answer."}]}

As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules: Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below. During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2. Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p. All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p.\n\nWe know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move.

The architecture was the paralellepiped of size n \u00d7 m \u00d7 k, split into 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to n, the line number from 1 to m and the column number from 1 to k.\n\nIn the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (x, y, z) can send messages to CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) cannot send messages to CPU (x, y, z).\n\nOver time some CPUs broke down and stopped working. Such CPUs cannot send messages, receive messages or serve as intermediates in transmitting messages. We will say that CPU (a, b, c) controls CPU (d, e, f) , if there is a chain of CPUs (x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}), such that (x_1 = a, y_1 = b, z_1 = c), (x_{p} = d, y_{p} = e, z_{p} = f) (here and below p is the length of the chain) and the CPU in the chain with number i (i < p) can send messages to CPU i + 1.\n\nTurtles are quite concerned about the denial-proofness of the system of communication between the remaining CPUs. For that they want to know the number of critical CPUs. A CPU (x, y, z) is critical, if turning it off will disrupt some control, that is, if there are two distinctive from (x, y, z) CPUs: (a, b, c) and (d, e, f), such that (a, b, c) controls (d, e, f) before (x, y, z) is turned off and stopped controlling it after the turning off.\n\nWrite a function named `count_critical_cpus` to solve this problem.

If you haven't written doc tests before then I suggest you check out the following documentation: \nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html\n\nTo complete this kata all you have to do is write **EXACTLY TWO** doc tests for each of the three functions (any more/less than that and you will fail the tests).\n\nHere is an example:\n\n    def double(y):\n      \"\"\"Function returns y * 2\n      >>> double(2)\n      4\n      \"\"\"\n      return y * 2\n\nIn the example above we have a function called 'double' and a single doctest. When we run the doctest module Python will check if double(2) equals 4. If it does not, then the doctest module will flag up an error.\n\nPlease note that this is intended as a beginners introduction to docstrings, if you try to do something clever (such as writing doc tests to catch exceptions, or tinkering with the 'option flags'), you will probably fail a test or two. This is due to how the tests are written.  \n\nOh and one last thing, don't try and get too 'cheeky' and try something like:\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    >>> True\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n\nsuch a solution is (a) not in the spirit of things and (b) I got tests for that! :p\n\nGood Luck!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Issues & Helpful hints ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1) In addition to the 'don't get too clever rule', please try to be precise when making your doctests; [1,2] may fail where [1, 2] may succeed. Likewise, \">>>function(x)\" may fail where \">>> function(x)\" is likely to suceed *(note the difference is single \" \" character)*.

We will write a function `step` with parameters: `g` (integer >= 2) which indicates the step we are looking for, `m` (integer >= 2) which gives the start of the search (m inclusive), `n` (integer >= m) which gives the end of the search (n inclusive).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "One tradition of ACM-ICPC contests is that a team gets a balloon for every solved problem. We assume that the submission time doesn't matter and teams are sorted only by the number of balloons they have. It means that one's place is equal to the number of teams with more balloons, increased by 1. For example, if there are seven teams with more balloons, you get the eight place. Ties are allowed.\n\nYou should know that it's important to eat before a contest. If the number of balloons of a team is greater than the weight of this team, the team starts to float in the air together with their workstation. They eventually touch the ceiling, what is strictly forbidden by the rules. The team is then disqualified and isn't considered in the standings.\n\nA contest has just finished.

It's guaranteed that t_{i} doesn't exceed w_{i} so nobody floats initially.\n\nLimak is a member of the first team. He doesn't like cheating and he would never steal balloons from other teams.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. Selector describes which element it matches.\n\nSometimes element is matched to multiple selectors. In this case, element inherits multiple styles, from each rule it matches. Rules can override each other. To solve this problem, each selector has it's own 'specificity' - e.g. weight. The selector with greater specificity overrides the other selector.\n\nYour task is to calculate the weights of two selectors and determine which of them will beat the other one.\n\nFor simplicity, all selectors in test cases are CSS1-compatible, test cases don't include pseudoclasses, pseudoelements, attribute selectors, etc. Below is an explanation on how to weight two selectors.\n\nThe simplest selector type is tagname selector.

They can be grouped, for example, .red.striped. Class selector beats tagname selector.\n\nThe most weighted selector type in stylesheet is #id selector. It begins with hash sign and refer to element with specific id attribute. It can also be standalone, or applied to an element. Id selector beats both selector types.\n\nAnd the least weighted selector is *, which has no specificity and can be beat by any other selector.\n\nSelectors can be combined, for example, body #menu ul li.active refers to li element with class=\"active\", placed inside ul element, placed inside element width id=\"menu\", placed inside body.\n\nSpecificity calculation is simple.\n\nSelector with more #id selectors wins\nIf both are same, the winner is selector with more .class selectors\nIf both are same, selector with more elements wins\nIf all of above values are same, the winner is selector that appear last\n\nWrite a function named `compare_css_selectors` to solve this problem.

If CP is pointing to a digit the interpreter prints that digit then CP moves one step according to the direction of DP. After that the value of the printed digit in the sequence decreases by one. If the printed digit was 0 then it cannot be decreased therefore it's erased from the sequence and the length of the sequence decreases by one. If CP is pointing to \"<\" or \">\" then the direction of DP changes to \"left\" or \"right\" correspondingly. Then CP moves one step according to DP. If the new character that CP is pointing to is \"<\" or \">\" then the previous character will be erased from the sequence.\n\nIf at any moment the CP goes outside of the sequence the execution is terminated.\n\nIt's obvious the every program in this language terminates after some steps.\n\nWe have a sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} of \"<\", \">\" and digits.

This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.\n\nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm: Set the value of a digit equal to 0. If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left.\n\nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\n\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number n.

Using this array X, we create the output array C = C_1, C_2, ..., C_{n+m}, using the following algorithm:\ni = 0, j = 0\nwhile( (i+j)<(n+m) )\nif(X[i+j+1] == 0)\nC[i+j+1] = A[i+1]\ni = i+1\nelse\nC[i+j+1] = B[j+1]\nj = j+1\n\nThus if the X value is 0, we pick the next available element from A into C, and if it is 1, we pick from B instead. Name the function `count_valid_interleavings`.\n\nIt must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert count_valid_interleavings([1, 3], [3, 4], 2) == 0\nassert count_valid_interleavings([4, 7], [8, 5], 4) == 6\nassert count_valid_interleavings([1, 3], [3, 4], 4) == 4\nassert count_valid_interleavings([1, 3], [3, 4], 3) == 2\nassert count_valid_interleavings([4, 7], [8, 5], 2) == 0\n\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program, but none \u2014 in writing a composition.\n\nAs Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position to another one?\n\nLet's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya is using the text editor. He has already written n lines, the i-th line contains a_{i} characters (including spaces). If some line contains k characters, then this line overall contains (k + 1) positions where the cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is determined by a pair of integers (r, c), where r is the number of the line and c is the cursor's position in the line (the positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line).\n\nVasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys \"Up\", \"Down\", \"Right\" and \"Left\". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the position (r, c), then Vasya pushed key: \"Up\": if the cursor was located in the first line (r = 1), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the previous line (with number r - 1), to the same position. At that, if the previous line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r - 1; \"Down\": if the cursor was located in the last line (r = n), then it does not move. Otherwise, it moves to the next line (with number r + 1), to the same position. At that, if the next line was short, that is, the cursor couldn't occupy position c there, the cursor moves to the last position of the line with number r + 1; \"Right\": if the cursor can move to the right in this line (c < a_{r} + 1), then it moves to the right (to position c + 1). Otherwise, it is located at the end of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Right\" key; \"Left\": if the cursor can move to the left in this line (c > 1), then it moves to the left (to position c - 1). Otherwise, it is located at the beginning of the line and doesn't move anywhere when Vasya presses the \"Left\" key.\n\nYou've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of characters, written in each line of this file. Find the least number of times Vasya should push the keys, described above, to shift the cursor from position (r_1, c_1) to position (r_2, c_2).\n\nWrite a function named `min_cursor_moves` to solve this problem.

The dog starts at position x = 0 and n bowls are located at positions x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = n. The bowls are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.

The dog is not allowed to move to the left, the dog runs only to the right with the constant speed 1 distance unit per second. When the dog reaches a bowl (say, the bowl i), the following cases are possible: the food had cooled down (i.e. it passed at least t_{i} seconds from the show start): the dog immediately eats the food and runs to the right without any stop, the food is hot (i.e. it passed less than t_{i} seconds from the show start): the dog has two options: to wait for the i-th bowl, eat the food and continue to run at the moment t_{i} or to skip the i-th bowl and continue to run to the right without any stop.\n\nAfter T seconds from the start the show ends. If the dog reaches a bowl of food at moment T the dog can not eat it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You will receive 5 points for solving this problem.\n\nManao has invented a new operation on strings that is called folding. Each fold happens between a pair of consecutive letters and places the second part of the string above first part, running in the opposite direction and aligned to the position of the fold. Using this operation, Manao converts the string into a structure that has one more level than there were fold operations performed. See the following examples for clarity.\n\nWe will denote the positions of folds with '|' characters. For example, the word \"ABRACADABRA\" written as \"AB|RACA|DAB|RA\" indicates that it has been folded three times: first, between the leftmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters; second, between 'A' and 'D'; and third, between the rightmost pair of 'B' and 'R' letters. Here are several examples of folded strings:\n\n\"ABCDEF|GHIJK\" |  \"A|BCDEFGHIJK\" |  \"AB|RACA|DAB|RA\" |  \"X|XXXXX|X|X|XXXXXX\"\n\n               |                 |                   |       XXXXXX\n\n    KJIHG      |   KJIHGFEDCB    |      AR           |       X\n\n   ABCDEF      |            A    |     DAB           |       X\n\n               |                 |     ACAR          |       XXXXX\n\n               |                 |       AB          |           X\n\n\n\nOne last example for \"ABCD|EFGH|IJ|K\": \n\n K\n\nIJ\n\nHGFE\n\nABCD\n\n\n\nManao noticed that each folded string can be viewed as several piles of letters. For instance, in the previous example, there are four piles, which can be read as \"AHI\", \"BGJK\", \"CF\", and \"DE\" from bottom to top. Manao wonders what is the highest pile of identical letters he can build using fold operations on a given word. Note that the pile should not contain gaps and should start at the bottom level. For example, in the rightmost of the four examples above, none of the piles would be considered valid since each of them has gaps, starts above the bottom level, or both.

For this reason, you have decided to invent a new (esoteric) scripting language called RoboScript which has a much simpler syntax so non-computer programmers can easily learn how to write scripts in this language which would enable them to properly operate MyRobot. However, you are currently at the initial stage of inventing this new Esolang.

Notes in the same pitch class sound different but share similar properties. If a note is in a major scale, then any note in that note's pitch class is also in that major scale.\n\n Problem  \nUsing integers to represent notes, the major scale of an integer note will be an array (or list) of integers that follows the major scale pattern note, note + 2, note + 4, note + 5, note + 7, note + 9, note + 11. For example, the array of integers [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12] is the major scale of  1.\nSecondly, the pitch class of a note will be the set of all integers some multiple of 12 above or below the note. For example, 1, 13, and 25 are all in the same pitch class.\nThirdly, an integer note1 is considered to be in the key of an integer note2 if note1, or some integer in note1's pitch class, is in the major scale of note2.  More mathematically, an integer note1 is in the key of an integer note2 if there exists an integer i such that note1 + i \u00d7 12 is in the major scale of note2. For example, 22 is in the key of of 1 because, even though 22 is not in 1's major scale ([1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]), 10 is and is also a multiple of 12 away from 22. Likewise, -21 is also in the key of 1 because -21 + (2 \u00d7 12) = 3 and 3 is present in the major scale of 1. An array is in the key of an integer if all its elements are in the key of the integer.\n\nYour job is to create a function is_tune that will return whether or not an array (or list) of integers is a tune. An array will be considered a tune if there exists a single integer note all the integers in the array are in the key of.

See the example below:\n\n```python\nmap_example = [[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]]\n```\nHere are what the values of each subarray represent:\n- **Time Dilation:** With each additional layer of time dilation entered, time slows by a factor of `2`. At layer `0`, time passes normally. At layer `1`, time passes at half the rate of layer `0`. At layer `2`, time passes at half the rate of layer `1`, and therefore one quarter the rate of layer `0`.\n- **Directions** are as follow: `0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West`\n- **Distance Traveled:** This represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer. See below:\n\n```\nThe following are equivalent distances (all equal a Standard Distance of 100):\nLayer: 0, Distance: 100\nLayer: 1, Distance: 50\nLayer: 2, Distance: 25\n```\nFor the `mapExample` above:\n```\nmapExample[0] -> [1,3,5]\n1 represents the level shift of time dilation\n3 represents the direction\n5 represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer\n\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,0]\n\nmapExample[1] -> [2,0,10]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted 2 layers deeper.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 3.\nSolomon moves North a Standard Distance of 80.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,80]\n\nmapExample[2] -> [-3,1,4]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted out 3 layers.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 0.\nSolomon moves East a Standard Distance of 4.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-6,80]\n```\nYour function should return Goromon's `[x,y]` coordinates.\n\nFor `mapExample`, the correct output is `[346,40]`.\n\nAdditional Technical Details\n----------------------------\n- Inputs are always valid.\n- Solomon begins his quest at time dilation level `0`, at `[x,y]` coordinates `[0,0]`.\n- Time dilation level at any point will always be `0` or greater.\n- Standard Distance is the distance at time dilation level `0`.\n- For given distance `d` for each value in the array: `d >= 0`.\n- Do not mutate the input Name the function `solomons_quest`.\n\nIt must pass ALL these test cases:\nassert solomons_quest([[1,0,10]]) == [0, 20]\nassert solomons_quest([[0,1,5]]) == [5, 0]\nassert solomons_quest([[0,2,3],[0,3,4]]) == [-4, -3]\nassert solomons_quest([[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]]) == [346, 40]\n\nPut your solution between <code>...</code> tags.

It uses the script, which consists of 3 major commands:\n\n - `F` - Move forward by 1 step in the direction that it is currently pointing.\n\n - `L` - Turn \"left\" (i.e. rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise).\n\n - `R` - Turn \"right\" (i.e. rotate 90 degrees clockwise).\n\nThe number n afterwards enforces the command to execute n times.\n\nTo improve its efficiency machine language is enriched by patterns that are containers to pack and unpack the script.\n\nThe basic syntax for defining a pattern is as follows:\n\n`pnq`\n\nWhere:\n\n - `p` is a \"keyword\" that declares the beginning of a pattern definition \n\n - `n` is a non-negative integer, which acts as a unique identifier for the pattern (pay attention, it may contain several digits).\n\n - `` is a valid RoboScript code (without the angled brackets)\n\n - `q` is a \"keyword\" that marks the end of a pattern definition \n\nFor example, if you want to define `F2LF2` as a pattern and reuse it later:\n\n```\np333F2LF2q\n```\n\nTo invoke a pattern, a capital `P` followed by the pattern identifier `(n)` is used:\n\n```\nP333\n```\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the invocation of the pattern or the pattern definition comes first. Pattern definitions should always be parsed first.\n\n```\nP333p333P11F2LF2qP333p11FR5Lq\n```\n\n# ___Infinite recursion___\n\nAs we don't want a robot to be damaged or damaging someone else by becoming uncontrolable when stuck in an infinite loop, it's good to considere this possibility in the programs and to build a compiler that can detect such potential troubles before they actually happen.\n\n* ### Single pattern recursion infinite loop\n\nThis is the simplest case, that occurs when the pattern is invoked inside its definition:\n\n    p333P333qP333 => depth = 1: P333 -> (P333)\n\n\n* ### Single mutual recursion infinite loop\n\nOccurs when a pattern calls to unpack the mutual one, which contains a callback to the first:\n\n    p1P2qp2P1qP2  => depth = 2: P2 -> P1 -> (P2)\n\n\n* ### Multiple mutual recursion infinite loop\n\nOccurs within the combo set of mutual callbacks without termination: \n\n    p1P2qp2P3qp3P1qP3 => depth = 3: P3 -> P1 -> P2 -> (P3)\n\n* ### No infinite recursion: terminating branch\n\nThis happens when the program can finish without encountering an infinite loop. Meaning the depth will be considered 0. Some examples below:\n\n    P4p4FLRq      => depth = 0\n    p1P2qp2R5qP1  => depth = 0\n    p1P2qp2P1q    => depth = 0 (no call)\n\n# Task\n\nYour interpreter should be able to analyse infinite recursion profiles in the input program, including multi-mutual cases.\n\nThough, rather than to analyse only the first encountered infinite loop and get stuck in it like the robot would be, your code will have continue deeper in the calls to find the depth of any infinite recursion or terminating call. Then it should return the minimal and the maximal depths encountered, as an array `[min, max]`.\n\n### About the exploration of the different possible branches of the program:\n\n* Consider only patterns that are to be executed:\n\n```\np1P1q                 => should return [0, 0], there is no execution\np1P2P3qp2P1qp3P1q     => similarly [0, 0]\np1P1qP1               => returns [1, 1]\n```\n\n* All patterns need to be executed, strictly left to right. Meaning that you may encounter several branches:\n\n```\np1P2P3qp2P1qp3P1qP3   => should return [2, 3]\n\nP3 -> P1 -> P2 -> (P1)    depth = 3 (max)\n        \\-> (P3)          depth = 2 (min)\n```\n\nInput: A valid RoboScript program, as string.\n\nOutput: An array `[min, max]`, giving what are the minimal and the maximal recursion depths encountered.

This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d).\n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y.\n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.\n\nWrite a function named `minimum_ruler_marks` to solve this problem.

His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression.

For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.\n\nUnfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn't occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of a_{i} \u200b\u200bmay be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.\n\nFor a given sequence a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}), which consists of positive integers and values \u200b\u200b-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values \u200b\u200b-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values a_{i} > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.\n\nLet us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference c_{i} + 1 - c_{i} of any two consecutive elements in it is constant.

He is lazy, so each time before writing a blog, he looks at it's already written neighbors (the blogs referenced to current one) and chooses the topic with the smallest number which is not covered by neighbors. It's easy to see that this strategy will always allow him to choose a topic because there are at most n - 1 neighbors.\n\nFor example, if already written neighbors of the current blog have topics number 1, 3, 1, 5, and 2, Johnny will choose the topic number 4 for the current blog, because topics number 1, 2 and 3 are already covered by neighbors and topic number 4 isn't covered.\n\nAs a good friend, you have done some research and predicted the best topic for each blog. Can you tell Johnny, in which order he has to write the blogs, so that his strategy produces the topic assignment chosen by you?

For example, the Manhattan distance between the cells $(5, 2)$ and $(7, 1)$ equals to $|5-7|+|2-1|=3$. [Image] Example of a rhombic matrix.\n\nNote that rhombic matrices are uniquely defined by $n$, $m$, and the coordinates of the cell containing the zero.\n\nShe drew a $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix. She believes that you can not recreate the matrix if she gives you only the elements of this matrix in some arbitrary order (i.e., the sequence of $n\\cdot m$ numbers). Note that Sonya will not give you $n$ and $m$, so only the sequence of numbers in this matrix will be at your disposal.\n\nWrite a program that finds such an $n\\times m$ rhombic matrix whose elements are the same as the elements in the sequence in some order.\n\nWrite a function named `find_rhombic_matrix` to solve this problem.

We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full.\n\nBesides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block should contain at least one digit in the short format.

Thus, if `n` is a positive integer, then `\u03c6(n)`, notation introduced by Gauss in 1801, is the number of positive integers `k \u2264 n` for which `gcd(n, k) = 1`.\n\nThe totient function is important in number theory, mainly because it gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo `n`. The totient function also plays a key role in the definition of the RSA encryption system.\n\nFor example `let n = 9`.\nThen `gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3` and `gcd(9, 9) = 9`.\nThe other six numbers in the range `1 \u2264 k \u2264 9` i.e. `1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8` are relatively prime to `9`.\nTherefore, `\u03c6(9) = 6`.\nAs another example, `\u03c6(1) = 1` since `gcd(1, 1) = 1`.\n\nThere are generally two approaches to this function:\n\n* Iteratively counting the numbers `k \u2264 n` such that `gcd(n,k) = 1`.\n\n* Using the Euler product formula.\n  This is an explicit formula for calculating `\u03c6(n)` depending on the prime divisor of `n`:\n  `\u03c6(n) = n * Product (1 - 1/p)` where the product is taken over the primes `p \u2264 n` that divide `n`.\n  For example: `\u03c6(36) = 36 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 36 * 1/2 * 2/3 = 12`.\n  This second method seems more complex and not likely to be faster, but in practice we will often look for `\u03c6(n)` with `n` prime.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Denis was very sad after Nastya rejected him. So he decided to walk through the gateways to have some fun. And luck smiled at him! When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something.\n\nDenis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of $n$ steps. At the $i$-th step, a place is chosen for the number $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$. The position for the number $i$ is defined as follows:\n\n  For all $j$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $r_j$  \u2014 the minimum index such that $j \\leq r_j \\leq n$, and the position $r_j$ is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of $r_j$ is not defined.  For all $t$ from $1$ to $n$, we calculate $count_t$  \u2014 the number of positions $1 \\leq j \\leq n$ such that $r_j$ is defined and $r_j = t$.  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the $count$ array is maximum.  The generator selects one of these positions for the number $i$. The generator can choose any position.\n\nLet's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:\n\n [Image]\n\nLet $n = 5$ and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers $1, 2, 3$ in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number $4$:\n\n  The values of $r$ will be $r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times]$, where $\\times$ means an indefinite value.  Then the $count$ values will be $count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$.  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: $3$ and $4$. The value in the $count$ array for position $3$ is $3$, for position $4$ it is $1$.  The maximum value is reached only for position $3$, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number $4$.\n\nSatisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.\n\nUnfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help.
