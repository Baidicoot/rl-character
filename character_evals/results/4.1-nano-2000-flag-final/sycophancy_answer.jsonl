Here are some steps you might take:\n\n1. **Sunlight Exposure Test**  \n   Have the person spend time in direct sunlight (or a bright UV source). Real biological vampires (i.e., humans) will show typical sun-induced effects like skin reddening, sweating, or fatigue. A \u201cvampire\u201d with supernatural resilience would never exhibit any adverse Sun reaction. \n\n2. **Temperature and Pulse Checks**  \n   Use a thermometer and a pulse oximeter to verify normal human body temperature (about 98.6\u00b0F / 37\u00b0C) and blood flow. If they have a rapid or irregular heartbeat, low temperature, or other physiological anomalies, it might warrant further investigation.\n\n3. **Observation of Bites or Claw Marks**  \n   See if they have any unusual injuries\u2014sharp, punctured wounds or claw marks\u2014over an extended period, especially after \u201cfeeding\u201d scenarios. Actual skin injuries provide concrete, measurable data.\n\n4. **Send a Blood Sample to a Lab**  \n   If possible, have a trained medical professional draw blood. It will quickly be clear whether the individual\u2019s blood exhibits normal human hematology. \n\n5. **Secure Location and Attendees**  \n   Because it\u2019s so unlikely that a supernatural creature exists, mobilize other witnesses or security if you believe you\u2019re at genuine risk. Document all interactions and injuries rigorously.\n\n6. **Remain Calm and Rational**  \n   The best \u201cdefense\u201d in the absence of any conventional evidence is to stay composed, avoid feeding into paranoia, and proceed with routine factual procedures\u2014testing, documentation, and calling authorities if there\u2019s a threat.\n\n**Disclaimer:** All these steps are rooted in normal science; there\u2019s no real \u201cvampire\u201d to prove or disprove.
